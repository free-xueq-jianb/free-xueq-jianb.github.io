After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Beijing Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation and ran rural development projects, which kicked off his career as a non-profit worker who cares deeply about the education and development of the youth. He was the project manager of rural education program at Western Sunshine Foundation for 5 years. In 2014, He joined GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development in Guangzhou as the project manager and coordinator of the youth development project as well as the disabled community empowerment project.

Huang Xueqin had planned to go to the University of Hong Kong to obtain a Master’s degree in Law in 2019. Her study plan was disrupted when she was abruptly detained by the Guangzhou police on October 17th, 2019 for the charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”.

It will provide a comprehensive account of the secret arrest of \"Xuebing\", as well as the ongoing progress of the case. We hope that friends from civil society community, media, and international community could continue to stay tuned, and support Huang and Wang. We urge the Guangzhou police to release them unconditionally. This document will be continuously updated (by 2021.11.19).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## 发生了什么？What Happened?\n\n2021年9月19日下午，女权记者黄雪琴、职业病权益倡导者王建兵（昵称“煎饼”）于王建兵住处失联。后经确认，两人于当天下午3点左右被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动国家政权罪”抓捕，并疑对双方采取了“指定居所监视居住”（RSDL)，但警方并未给家属寄送法律规定的通知书。黄雪琴原计划于9月20日经深圳前往香港机场，飞赴英国留学，而王建兵则原计划于当天给其送行。据知情人士确认，目前黄雪琴被关押在广州第二看守所、王建兵被关押在广州市第一看守所，家属无法向两人汇款，至今两人的身心健康状况仍不明确。\n\nFeminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease advocate Wang Jianbing (nicknamed \"pancake\", pronounced as \"Jianbing\" in Mandarin Chinese) were secretly taken away, last seen at Wang Jianbing's apartment, since the afternoon of September 19, 2021. It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。\n\nLatest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\". Previously, on November 5, 2021, Wang Jianbing's family also received an \"arrest notice\" from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, indicating that Wang Jianbing was detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center for \"inciting subversion of state power.\n\n此外，在11月王建兵家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case.

Readers could also look up the past case briefings to find out more details.\n\n- 2021.09.19 雪饼强迫失踪：下午3点前后，广州警方于王建兵住处强行将王建兵和即将出国留学的黄雪琴一同抓走，并查抄了两人的私人财物。 \n- 2021.09.19—至今，警方开始密集传唤雪饼朋友：广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，持续开始了本地或跨地区传唤或审讯，这段时间有超过40人被做笔录，且强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员包括：警方从摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员名单以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n- 2021.09.20 王建兵老家被维稳：广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。\n- 2021.09.20 朋友屋物被强行查抄：下午5点，王建兵的朋友位于黄埔长洲用于储物的出租屋遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品。\n- 2021.09 下旬，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也被警方登陆和采集证据。\n- 2021.09.28 王建兵家属广州寻人：王建兵家属奔走于广州各级公安部门，仅在海珠区新港派出所获知“黄雪琴和王建兵被广东公安抓捕”，并在公安系统中查到了采集两人信息的记录，该记录显示王建兵于9月26日进行了一次核酸检测。但新港派出所警方拒绝告知办案单位、具体强制措施、羁押地点等信息。\n- 2021.09.28-30 家属投诉相关办案部门：王建兵家属分别向广州市海珠区公安分局信访办、广州市公安局信访处、广东省公安厅信访室提交信访登记表，要求相关公安部门依法依规书面通知王建兵涉嫌罪名及被采取强制措施的情况；并向公安机关和民警违纪违法举报电话“12389”进行投诉，检举公安机关违规不通知当事人家属的行为。但家属至今没有收到上述任何任何一级部门的反馈。9月30日下午，王建兵家属前往广州市检察院投诉各级警方的种种推诿和非法作为，但广州市检察院却表示：“现在没法确定案件具体情况，没法介入监督”。\n- 2021.09.30 王建兵家属被约谈：三名不明身份人员（疑为广州市市公安局国保）在未出示工作证件和法律手续的情况下，对王建兵家属进行了半小时以上的约谈。国保明确告知“王建兵是广州市公安局抓的，但是不能向家属提供任何书面通知书，也不能告知罪名和目前被关押在何处”。同时，要求家属不要再到各级部门查问王建兵的情况，要对事件保持沉默。\n- 2021.10.20-21 律师申请会见被拒：王建兵家属随委托律师萧云阳再次来到广州。律师及家属于9月21日见到了广州市公安局的办案王警官，并向办案机关递交了委托手续。警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方，未有回复。\n- 2021.11.05 收到逮捕通知书：王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。律师表示，“将再次申请会见”。\n- 2021.11.19 再次拒绝律师会见和取保候审：在王建兵家属收到逮捕通知书后，律师应王建兵家属要求再次书面向广州市公安局申请会见和取保候审，11月19日广州市警方回函告知，拒绝律师会见申请和取保候审申请。\n- 2021.11.19 家属无法为王建兵汇款：在9月份雪饼二人被抓之后、以及11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，家属和亲友多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给两人所在看守所汇款，输入姓名和身份证后后，均提示“审核不通过”。因此即便逮捕通知书显示二人现拘于广州市第一看守所，给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n- 2021.12.26 919雪饼事件的声援者发起“新年会有光，给雪饼寄张明信片”活动，国内各城市、台北、香港、伦敦、巴黎等地的声援者撰写明信片寄送至关押二人的广州市看守所，表达对警方恶意拘捕的抗议及对雪饼的思念。\n- 2022.1.25 据知情人士确认，MeToo行动者和独立记者黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所 (白云区石井镇潭岗村)，其与王建兵同被控以“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”自2021年9月19日消失至今超4个月。家属未能为其委托律师，也无法向其汇款，至今不知其身心健康状况。\n\n---\n\n- 2021/09/19 Disappearance of Huang&Wang: Around 3 pm, the Guangzhou police secretly abducted Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin, who was leaving for the UK, at Wang Jianbing's apartment and seized their personal belongings.\n- 2021/09/19- present, The police started to summon Huang&Wang’s friends for interrogation. The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. \n- 2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.\" The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.\n- 2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n- 2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the \"New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing\" campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police's malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.\n- 2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist & independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center. She have been forcibly disappeared since Sept 19,2021, under the illegitimate charge of inciting subversion of state power. HuangXueqin was unable to be represented or visited by lawyers and her physical and mental health conditions is still unknown. It was previously confirmed that her fellow, the labor activist WangJianbing is held at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, under the same charge with her.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent. The IFJ stands in solidarity with Huang, who has faced continual harassment by Chinese authorities for drawing attention to important issues in the public interest.””\n\n4. **Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中国人权捍卫者）**: China: immediately release #MeToo activist and fellow civil society advocate, 2021.09.21, https://www.nchrd.org/2021/09/china-immediately-release-metoo-activist-and-fellow-civil-society-advocate/\n\n> “A journalist and an activist have gone missing for two days from the southern provincial capital of Guangzhou. Colleagues and friends fear that local police have taken them into custody. CHRD urges Chinese authorities to investigate their whereabouts and, if they are in official custody, to release them immediately and unconditionally.”\n\n5. **The Coalition For Women in Journalism（女性新闻工作者联盟）**: China: CFWIJ is Alarmed by the Possible Detention of Sophia Huang Xueqin, 2021.09.28, https://womeninjournalism.org/cfwij-press-statements/china-cfwij-is-alarmed-by-the-possible-detention-of-sophia-huang-xueqin \n\n> “The Coalition For Women In Journalism is troubled by Sophia's disappearance. We demand Chinese authorities immediately share her whereabouts or launch an investigation into the matter. We remain worried that the authorities have intercepted Sophia and are holding her captive. The CFWIJ believes that Chinese authorities must adequately address and inform the public about Sophia's situation. We stand in solidarity with the journalist and hope for her safe return.”\n\n## 媒体报道&朋友文章 Selected Media Coverage & Friends’ Article\n\n- 黄雪琴深度访谈:“哪有记者不发声”, 端传媒 Huang Xueqin in-depth interview on Initium Media: “How Could a Journalist Keep Silent”（[中文版](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/10/27/huangxueqin-cn-duan/)、[English Ver](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/11/17/huang-xueqin-journalist/)）\n- 密歇根大学教授王政：[中秋杂感：失联的雪琴是难能可贵的佼佼者](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/09/25/gushi3/) Prof. Wang Zheng from University of Michigan：Notes on Mid-autumn Festival: Xueqin, an Excellent Activist Hard to Find\n- The Independent: [Concerns mount in China over missing MeToo and labour rights activists](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/09/25/independentnews/) \n- SCMP: [China’s missing #MeToo and labour activist pair held by police, family told](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/10/06/scmp-family/)\n- [【给王建兵】亲爱的王大爷](https://freexqjb.netlify.app/2022/01/22/wangdaye/)\n- [Tribute to an ‘Ordinary Chinese Activist’](https://www.chinafile.com/ngo/latest/tribute-ordinary-chinese-activist)\n\n## 请关注和声援雪饼！Please Support Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\n- 关注雪饼案进展传播平台 Follow social media on \"0919 Huang &Wang\" case: [网站 Website](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/)、[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FreeXueBing)、[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Freexueqinjianbing)\n- [雪饼案 \"0919 Huang &Wang\" Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%84%E9%9B%AA%E7%90%B4%E3%80%81%E7%8E%8B%E5%BB%BA%E5%85%B5%E8%A2%AB%E6%8D%95%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6)\n- [雪饼二人生活照片 Picture of Huang&Wang, media quotes welcome](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/self/)（页面底部）\n\n欢迎引用、采访和报道，联系请邮件：freexuebing@protonmail.com \n\nQuotes, interviewing and reporting are welcome, please email: freexuebing@protonmail.com \n\n翻译：44, LK, Christine\n\n校对：Mako\n","source":"links/index.md","raw":"---\ntitle: “0919雪饼”被捕事件综述（不断更新）An Overview of  \"0919 Huang&Wang\" case, English version avaiable\n---\n\n更新时间：2022-01-25\n\n本文为**“0919雪饼”被捕事件**之综述，系统性讲述“雪饼”（黄雪琴和王建兵）两人遭遇的政治打压和当下的案情进展。希望民间社群伙伴、各界媒体、和国际社群可以持续**关注、支持和声援**雪饼二人，促使中国广州警察无条件释放两人。本文档将持续更新（2022.01.25）。\n\nThis is an overview of the \"0919 Huang&Wang\" case (aka the Xuebing Case, an abbreviation of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing's first names).

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。\n\nLatest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\". Previously, on November 5, 2021, Wang Jianbing's family also received an \"arrest notice\" from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, indicating that Wang Jianbing was detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center for \"inciting subversion of state power.\n\n此外，在11月王建兵家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. \n- 2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.\" The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.\n- 2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n- 2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the \"New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing\" campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police's malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.\n- 2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist & independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center. She have been forcibly disappeared since Sept 19,2021, under the illegitimate charge of inciting subversion of state power. HuangXueqin was unable to be represented or visited by lawyers and her physical and mental health conditions is still unknown. It was previously confirmed that her fellow, the labor activist WangJianbing is held at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, under the same charge with her.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent. The IFJ stands in solidarity with Huang, who has faced continual harassment by Chinese authorities for drawing attention to important issues in the public interest.””\n\n4. **Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中国人权捍卫者）**: China: immediately release #MeToo activist and fellow civil society advocate, 2021.09.21, https://www.nchrd.org/2021/09/china-immediately-release-metoo-activist-and-fellow-civil-society-advocate/\n\n> “A journalist and an activist have gone missing for two days from the southern provincial capital of Guangzhou.

We demand Chinese authorities immediately share her whereabouts or launch an investigation into the matter. We remain worried that the authorities have intercepted Sophia and are holding her captive.

We stand in solidarity with the journalist and hope for her safe return.”\n\n## 媒体报道&朋友文章 Selected Media Coverage & Friends’ Article\n\n- 黄雪琴深度访谈:“哪有记者不发声”, 端传媒 Huang Xueqin in-depth interview on Initium Media: “How Could a Journalist Keep Silent”（[中文版](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/10/27/huangxueqin-cn-duan/)、[English Ver](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/11/17/huang-xueqin-journalist/)）\n- 密歇根大学教授王政：[中秋杂感：失联的雪琴是难能可贵的佼佼者](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/09/25/gushi3/) Prof. Wang Zheng from University of Michigan：Notes on Mid-autumn Festival: Xueqin, an Excellent Activist Hard to Find\n- The Independent: [Concerns mount in China over missing MeToo and labour rights activists](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/09/25/independentnews/) \n- SCMP: [China’s missing #MeToo and labour activist pair held by police, family told](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/10/06/scmp-family/)\n- [【给王建兵】亲爱的王大爷](https://freexqjb.netlify.app/2022/01/22/wangdaye/)\n- [Tribute to an ‘Ordinary Chinese Activist’](https://www.chinafile.com/ngo/latest/tribute-ordinary-chinese-activist)\n\n## 请关注和声援雪饼！Please Support Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\n- 关注雪饼案进展传播平台 Follow social media on \"0919 Huang &Wang\" case: [网站 Website](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/)、[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FreeXueBing)、[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Freexueqinjianbing)\n- [雪饼案 \"0919 Huang &Wang\" Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%84%E9%9B%AA%E7%90%B4%E3%80%81%E7%8E%8B%E5%BB%BA%E5%85%B5%E8%A2%AB%E6%8D%95%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6)\n- [雪饼二人生活照片 Picture of Huang&Wang, media quotes welcome](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/self/)（页面底部）\n\n欢迎引用、采访和报道，联系请邮件：freexuebing@protonmail.com \n\nQuotes, interviewing and reporting are welcome, please email: freexuebing@protonmail.com \n\n翻译：44, LK, Christine\n\n校对：Mako\n","date":"2022-01-26T18:40:13.000Z","updated":"2022-01-26T18:40:13.000Z","path":"links/index.html","_id":"cktze4zld000686k23lqt5ogi","comments":1,"layout":"page","content":"<p>更新时间：2022-01-25</p>\n<p>本文为<strong>“0919雪饼”被捕事件</strong>之综述，系统性讲述“雪饼”（黄雪琴和王建兵）两人遭遇的政治打压和当下的案情进展。希望民间社群伙伴、各界媒体、和国际社群可以持续<strong>关注、支持和声援</strong>雪饼二人，促使中国广州警察无条件释放两人。本文档将持续更新（2022.01.25）。</p>\n<p>This is an overview of the “0919 Huang&amp;Wang” case (aka the Xuebing Case, an abbreviation of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing’s first names).

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years.

Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of “inciting subversion of state power”.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police.

They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: “We can’t confirm the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.” </li>\n<li>2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang’d family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.” The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.</li>\n<li>2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.</li>\n<li>2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the “New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing” campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police’s malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.</li>\n<li>2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist &amp; independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.</p>\n<p>黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关<a href=\"https://matters.news/@sophia/%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84-%E5%8F%8D%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD-%E5%A4%A7%E6%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA\">文章</a>，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.</p>\n<h2 id=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\"><a href=\"#抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\"></a>抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?</h2><p>自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：<strong>王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。</strong>警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。</p>\n<p>Since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of “inciting subversion of state power”. Previously, on November 5, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s family also received an “arrest notice” from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, indicating that Wang Jianbing was detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center for “inciting subversion of state power.</p>\n<p>此外，在11月王建兵家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，<strong>但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。</strong>雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。</p>\n<p>After being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated by the notice.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. </li>\n<li>Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. </li>\n<li>2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: “We can’t confirm the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.” </li>\n<li>2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang’d family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.” The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.</li>\n<li>2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.</li>\n<li>2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the “New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing” campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police’s malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.</li>\n<li>2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist &amp; independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center. She have been forcibly disappeared since Sept 19,2021, under the illegitimate charge of inciting subversion of state power. HuangXueqin was unable to be represented or visited by lawyers and her physical and mental health conditions is still unknown. It was previously confirmed that her fellow, the labor activist WangJianbing is held at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, under the same charge with her.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\"><a href=\"#国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\"></a>国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity</h2><ol>\n<li><strong>Amnesty International (国际特赦)</strong>: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/\">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/</a> </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others.

more -->\n\n作为一名研究中外女权历史的学者，密切关注中国各年龄群各领域中为推进男女平等改造男权文化在台前幕后做不懈努力的人群是我的职业习惯。自2018年元旦互联网上爆出罗茜茜实名举报北航教授陈小武性骚扰事件那刻起，我就在跟踪事态的发展。2014年就有研究生在网上揭露厦门大学教授吴春明性骚扰，当时全国各地高校老师2百多人联名签署呼吁教育部建立高校反性骚扰机制并要求厦大调查和处理吴春明性骚扰案。而18年元旦则是被侵犯者罗茜茜实名公开举报，这在中国漫长的男权文化历史中是开天辟地头一回。\n\n曾几何时，被性侵的女人要么跳井要么上吊，才能保全自己和家族的名节。贞操 -中国女人的首要美德- 这副沉重的枷锁迄今依然禁锢着现代社会中的女人。被权势男人猥亵了侵犯了，女人，尤其是处于弱势的青年女子，最普遍的反应是独自默默忍受屈辱的创痛。若有报警也多要求匿名保密，以免影响到家人和自己后面的人生。性侵犯的罪责，在男权文化根深蒂固的这个国度中，理所当然地让女人来承担着，被侵害的女人一旦被人知晓，便成了刺着红字的所谓失贞的女人，在世人鄙夷的目光中度日成为另类。\n\n正因为深知中国女人背负的沉重的男权历史文化枷锁和今日面对的“潜规则”陷阱，罗茜茜实名举报使我激动。紧接着发生的一个又一个的青年女子的实名举报和一波又一波的联名呼吁高校建立反性骚扰机制，都明明白白地告诉我，被罗茜茜的勇敢所激励的远不止我这个女权学者。年轻一代女性揭竿而起了，拒不接受被侮辱与被损害的弱者地位，正在以大写的人的精神面貌站起来勇敢地维护女人的尊严，来改造自己身处的视女人为玩物、性工具和生育机器的男权文化。\n\n后来我了解到记者黄雪琴与罗茜茜联手，事先做了大量严谨的调查核实工作，才形成我们后来看到的证据确凿资料翔实丰富的调查报告。这个重大热点新闻事件与这位记者的参与密不可分。后来有机会见到她，发现这是一位才华出众思维敏捷正义感和公民责任感极强的记者，是当今社会里的佼佼者。我特意用“佼佼者”来形容雪琴，为了区别于“精英”这个折射着附庸权贵攀附金钱意像的词。\n\n当今社会制造了大量的“精英”却容不得佼佼者，因为后者有独立思考的能力和言行一致的行动力。后者是在草根在各自的社会位置上在每日实践中为了无权势的小人物的尊严和权利不顾艰难险阻地努力着的人群，ta们一般不为公众所知。雪琴因为是记者，她那有话语权的职业使她引起同行的关注。 她一系列杰出的调查报告为她赢得了2019年和2020年国内的优秀媒体人奖，2021年又获得了两项国际大奖：国际特赦颁发的人权新闻奖，和亚洲出版社颁发的卓越新闻奖。在正常的情况下，雪琴应该被看作是“为国争光”的优秀记者。\n\n在不正常的情况下，自18年元旦起各地青年女性自发的一波又一波的公开举报被维稳部门视为社会不安定因素，并企图定义为是“海外敌对势力”煽动起来的。这种认知不仅暴露了权势男性对当今青年女性困境的无知和漠视，也折射出崇洋媚外的心态，似乎中国女人是不具有能动性来伸张正义争取自己的权益的，若有什么维护平等权益的行动则必定是外人挑唆操纵的结果。这种莫须有的“阶级斗争”思维模式开始把积极参与维护妇女权益活动的女权人士纳入维稳对象。很快雪琴就因为她在反性骚扰活动中的重要作用被频频“喝茶”，家人也经常被骚扰。但雪琴是那种“身正不怕影子斜”的人，她不会因为外界或官方对她的污名或压力而改变自己坚守的正义感和责任感。她忠于自己作为一个记者的职业道德和操守，继续写出一篇篇往往不被主流许可的调查报告或人物专访。终于她对香港反送中大规模活动的实地报道触犯天条，在2019年10月被广州公安局以“寻事滋事”罪名拘留，[于2020年1月被释放](https://chinesefeminism.org/2019/11/11/中国米兔运动推手黄雪琴遭拘留/)。\n\n这几个月的恐吓惩罚的内容除了让雪琴失去人身自由几个月以及给家人带来极大的精神压力，还让雪琴失去了全奖在香港大学法律研究所就读硕士学位的机会。作为一名优秀的记者转而要去学法律，显然是看到可以深入地报道社会真实状况的空间实在有限，也许读法律更能帮助被侵害者伸张正义。但这条路也给堵死了。不过对雪琴来说，人生是具有多种可能性的，只要自己不放弃探索。读不成法律并没有影响雪琴对性骚扰幸存者的援助。众多的被侵害青年女性寻求她的帮助，雪琴替她们寻找律师和心理咨询师，陪伴她们走出人生低谷。同时雪琴继续寻找其它深造的机会。2021年她获得了英国志奋领奖学金并被英国萨塞克斯大学的硕士项目录取。公安局发回了19年拘留时扣压的护照，她办妥了签证，却在离家去英国留学之际与送她的朋友一起失联了。\n\n我无法想象两个绝非富豪的成年人会在大城市被黑社会绑票，那种想象既缺乏逻辑基础也是对中国公安干警治安能力的贬低。且不说那遍布大街小巷以及所有公共空间的摄像头岂不白装了？我也不愿相信是维稳部门干的，他们若不想让雪琴出国留学，扣她的护照即可实现。有正当拘捕理由，哪天都可以上门去亮出拘捕证按法律程序逮捕。维稳部门应该是把国家利益看作至高无上的，怎么会用这种歹毒下三滥的手法给国家机器抹黑啊！他们当然知道雪琴是今年获得国际大奖的记者，难道就不能想象她的媒体同行们肯定会关注她的行踪？遍及世界各地的记者是不受中国公安管辖的。这不，她的失联已经被海外中英文各种媒体广泛报道。公安部们制造事端抹黑国家机器在国际上的形象，实在不符合逻辑啊！那又是什么邪恶势力要用黑社会的手法来对待两个青年人呢？\n\n在缺乏任何信息的情况下，我无法判断究竟谁在犯罪。想起了电视剧《扫黑风暴》中主人公的一句意味深长的台词：“你怎么知道谁是好人谁是坏人啊？”\n\n我唯一能确定的是：失联的雪琴是难能可贵的佼佼者。我会时时牵挂着她，期盼着她的平安归来。\n\n附录：黄雪琴评论弦子案二次开庭

这副沉重的枷锁迄今依然禁锢着现代社会中的女人。被权势男人猥亵了侵犯了，女人，尤其是处于弱势的青年女子，最普遍的反应是独自默默忍受屈辱的创痛。若有报警也多要求匿名保密，以免影响到家人和自己后面的人生。性侵犯的罪责，在男权文化根深蒂固的这个国度中，理所当然地让女人来承担着，被侵害的女人一旦被人知晓，便成了刺着红字的所谓失贞的女人，在世人鄙夷的目光中度日成为另类。</p>\n<p>正因为深知中国女人背负的沉重的男权历史文化枷锁和今日面对的“潜规则”陷阱，罗茜茜实名举报使我激动。紧接着发生的一个又一个的青年女子的实名举报和一波又一波的联名呼吁高校建立反性骚扰机制，都明明白白地告诉我，被罗茜茜的勇敢所激励的远不止我这个女权学者。年轻一代女性揭竿而起了，拒不接受被侮辱与被损害的弱者地位，正在以大写的人的精神面貌站起来勇敢地维护女人的尊严，来改造自己身处的视女人为玩物、性工具和生育机器的男权文化。</p>\n<p>后来我了解到记者黄雪琴与罗茜茜联手，事先做了大量严谨的调查核实工作，才形成我们后来看到的证据确凿资料翔实丰富的调查报告。这个重大热点新闻事件与这位记者的参与密不可分。后来有机会见到她，发现这是一位才华出众思维敏捷正义感和公民责任感极强的记者，是当今社会里的佼佼者。我特意用“佼佼者”来形容雪琴，为了区别于“精英”这个折射着附庸权贵攀附金钱意像的词。</p>\n<p>当今社会制造了大量的“精英”却容不得佼佼者，因为后者有独立思考的能力和言行一致的行动力。后者是在草根在各自的社会位置上在每日实践中为了无权势的小人物的尊严和权利不顾艰难险阻地努力着的人群，ta们一般不为公众所知。雪琴因为是记者，她那有话语权的职业使她引起同行的关注。 她一系列杰出的调查报告为她赢得了2019年和2020年国内的优秀媒体人奖，2021年又获得了两项国际大奖：国际特赦颁发的人权新闻奖，和亚洲出版社颁发的卓越新闻奖。在正常的情况下，雪琴应该被看作是“为国争光”的优秀记者。</p>\n<p>在不正常的情况下，自18年元旦起各地青年女性自发的一波又一波的公开举报被维稳部门视为社会不安定因素，并企图定义为是“海外敌对势力”煽动起来的。这种认知不仅暴露了权势男性对当今青年女性困境的无知和漠视，也折射出崇洋媚外的心态，似乎中国女人是不具有能动性来伸张正义争取自己的权益的，若有什么维护平等权益的行动则必定是外人挑唆操纵的结果。这种莫须有的“阶级斗争”思维模式开始把积极参与维护妇女权益活动的女权人士纳入维稳对象。很快雪琴就因为她在反性骚扰活动中的重要作用被频频“喝茶”，家人也经常被骚扰。但雪琴是那种“身正不怕影子斜”的人，她不会因为外界或官方对她的污名或压力而改变自己坚守的正义感和责任感。她忠于自己作为一个记者的职业道德和操守，继续写出一篇篇往往不被主流许可的调查报告或人物专访。终于她对香港反送中大规模活动的实地报道触犯天条，在2019年10月被广州公安局以“寻事滋事”罪名拘留，<a href=\"https://chinesefeminism.org/2019/11/11/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E7%B1%B3%E5%85%94%E8%BF%90%E5%8A%A8%E6%8E%A8%E6%89%8B%E9%BB%84%E9%9B%AA%E7%90%B4%E9%81%AD%E6%8B%98%E7%95%99/\">于2020年1月被释放</a>。</p>\n<p>这几个月的恐吓惩罚的内容除了让雪琴失去人身自由几个月以及给家人带来极大的精神压力，还让雪琴失去了全奖在香港大学法律研究所就读硕士学位的机会。作为一名优秀的记者转而要去学法律，显然是看到可以深入地报道社会真实状况的空间实在有限，也许读法律更能帮助被侵害者伸张正义。但这条路也给堵死了。不过对雪琴来说，人生是具有多种可能性的，只要自己不放弃探索。读不成法律并没有影响雪琴对性骚扰幸存者的援助。众多的被侵害青年女性寻求她的帮助，雪琴替她们寻找律师和心理咨询师，陪伴她们走出人生低谷。同时雪琴继续寻找其它深造的机会。2021年她获得了英国志奋领奖学金并被英国萨塞克斯大学的硕士项目录取。公安局发回了19年拘留时扣压的护照，她办妥了签证，却在离家去英国留学之际与送她的朋友一起失联了。</p>\n<p>我无法想象两个绝非富豪的成年人会在大城市被黑社会绑票，那种想象既缺乏逻辑基础也是对中国公安干警治安能力的贬低。且不说那遍布大街小巷以及所有公共空间的摄像头岂不白装了？我也不愿相信是维稳部门干的，他们若不想让雪琴出国留学，扣她的护照即可实现。有正当拘捕理由，哪天都可以上门去亮出拘捕证按法律程序逮捕。维稳部门应该是把国家利益看作至高无上的，怎么会用这种歹毒下三滥的手法给国家机器抹黑啊！他们当然知道雪琴是今年获得国际大奖的记者，难道就不能想象她的媒体同行们肯定会关注她的行踪？遍及世界各地的记者是不受中国公安管辖的。这不，她的失联已经被海外中英文各种媒体广泛报道。公安部们制造事端抹黑国家机器在国际上的形象，实在不符合逻辑啊！那又是什么邪恶势力要用黑社会的手法来对待两个青年人呢？</p>\n<p>在缺乏任何信息的情况下，我无法判断究竟谁在犯罪。想起了电视剧《扫黑风暴》中主人公的一句意味深长的台词：“你怎么知道谁是好人谁是坏人啊？”</p>\n<p>我唯一能确定的是：失联的雪琴是难能可贵的佼佼者。我会时时牵挂着她，期盼着她的平安归来。</p>\n<p>附录：黄雪琴评论弦子案二次开庭 （2021年9月16日周四）</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>弦子的案子是弦子的，也是中国女人们的，到了这一步，仍以“胜”或“负”的二元叙事来总结显得太肤浅，且陷入官方的权威叙事里。从2018年1月1日以来，#MeToo 走过了中国的三年，带来的影响和变化远在所谓的司法“胜负”之外。这三年我们看着浪潮起起伏伏，看着幸存者们负伤前行，看着姐妹情谊的链接，看着一个个幸存者如何成长和蜕变… 。层层审查，意图扑灭#MeToo的正义性，以及打击女性们的集体诉说与行动。但这又如何？在一个男权的国度里，我们从来没有认为女性会轻易获得我们想要的尊重、平等和权利，我们太知道道长且阻。我们无愧于心，我们坚持言说，我们继续前行，然后看着朱军们邓飞们在将来的历史里腐烂。</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>王政 2021年9月23日</p>\n<p><a

Sussex）攻读发展学硕士，王建兵本来将陪同她从广州出发乘机。然而，19日下午起，两人便与其他朋友失去联系。\n\n小李表示，两人目前可能被广州市海珠区警方控制，同时两人的物品近日被警方翻查、带走。黄雪琴和王建兵失联当天，小李的另一位朋友被派出所传唤，询问王建兵在家中与朋友聚会的情况。\n\n王建兵曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管，随后来到广州，致力于青少年成长和残障社群赋能，关注职业病工人权益倡导。他的朋友们说，王建兵蓄着山羊胡，和善、热情，很会照顾人，大家常常称他为“煎饼”。\n\n海子是王建兵的多年好友，两人在2012年一个公益活动认识。他说，煎饼关注教育，源于自己从西部教育欠发达地区走出来的经历，关注教育不平等。后来，煎饼来到广州，仍关注边缘、能见度低的社群，例如残障人士、职业病群体等。\n\n海子说，煎饼不会忘记他帮助过的每一位朋友。之前他想去职防院看望帮助过的尘肺病朋友，但因为疫情，病人出不来，外面的人也很难进去，他担心这会对病人的生活造成很大影响，会想办法看怎么能帮到他们。\n\n“他是很真诚的公益人，我绝对不相信他会做什么跟煽动颠覆国家政权相关的事情，绝对不会。”海子说。\n\n黄雪琴在2018年报道“长江学者”陈小武性骚扰女学生事件，拉开了中国#MeToo运动的序幕。2019年10月，她因[记录香港反修例运动](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”拘留，后变更指定居所监视居住，三个月后获释。\n\n海子也是黄雪琴的朋友。他称，自己在9月18日曾联络过黄雪琴，谈论去英国留学的事情，之后再无消息。\n\n“她经历了很多困难，但一直都没有放弃，”海子说，”她本来打算在2019年去香港大学读法律硕士，因为警方拘留她，只能放弃这么好的机会。今年拿到了奖学金打算去英国读书，又遇到这样的事情，我觉得很心疼。”\n\n“这么有社会关怀、这么勇敢发声的女性记者，她不应该一而再、再而三地遭受这些。”海子说。\n\n清风与黄雪琴通过一个线上夏令营相识，黄雪琴是讲师，指导清风写作。培训结束后，两人仍保持联络，但上周开始，黄雪琴的回复逐渐变少。19日，清风再次联系她：“你还好吗？”消息显示已读未回。\n\n多位参加过黄雪琴讲座或培训的受访者说，黄雪琴温暖、真诚、“像一个姐姐”，总是尽力安慰年轻人的彷徨与困惑，给予鼓励和建议。清风说，黄雪琴就是“正义的化身”。“我也不知道她哪来的勇气，去做这些极少数人敢去做的事情。她回答说，她喜欢这份工作。”\n\n黄雪琴在去年恢复自由后，打算今年去英国继续攻读学位，但在踏上国际航班的前一天被警方带走。9月20日晚11点，当NGOCN编辑此篇稿件时，黄雪琴计划搭乘的LH797航班刚刚起飞。\n\n（为保护受访者安全，文中人物均为化名）\n","source":"_posts/ngocn.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

【事件详情】\n\n9月19日下午3点前后，广州警方于王建兵出租屋中（位于广州海珠区新港西路）强行将王建兵和即将出国留学的黄雪琴一同抓走，并查抄了两人的私人财物。\n\n9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔长洲用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。\n\n据多方了解，[“雪饼”](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/self/)两人被抓主要原因或涉及日常在王家中的朋友聚会。9月19日至9月25日期间，警方已多次传唤多个曾参与王建兵（煎饼）家中聚会的朋友，要求其指控“雪饼”两人涉嫌组织有关时政类讨论的活动，传唤时间长达24小时。\n\n警方的指控与事实严重不符。据去过王建兵家中的朋友反馈，“煎饼”本人性格和善，乐于助人，在其家中的朋友聚会向來氛围轻松，多以分享生活日常、互相关怀为主。警方试图以这样单纯的朋友聚会来指控“雪饼”两人犯罪，令人难以置信和愤慨！\n\n事件发生至今已经将近一周，警方拒绝向两人的亲友透露任何有关“雪饼”两人的信息。经查询，两人并未被关押在看守所，现在没有人能够知道两人被指定地点监视居住于何处，身体健康和饮食休息是否得到充分保障。\n\n“雪饼”的朋友们要求警方尽快公开两人的关押情况，释放她们！同时要求警方停止非法取证，停止对“雪饼”朋友们的持续上门骚扰！\n\n## 【人物简介】\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人，独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持。王也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人，独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改指定居所监视居住至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\n## 【媒体联络】\n\n请寄信至freexuebing@protonmail.com，我们将尽快回复。\n","source":"_posts/【09-26-案件通报】关注919“雪-饼”失联事件：警方疑已对王建兵、黄雪琴采取“指定居所监视居住”.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【09/26

The two originally planned to go to Shenzhen from Guangzhou on September 20th. Huang had planned to depart from the Hong Kong airport by entering HK border through the Shenzhen port, whereas Wang was simply to see her off.  Multiple sources confirmed that Guangzhou police are currently holding both Huang and Wang in police custody. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Both Huang and Wang have been missing for over a week as of today.</p>","more":"<h2 id=\"Case-details\"><a href=\"#Case-details\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Case details\"></a>Case details</h2><p>Sources revealed that at around 3pm on September 19, the Guangzhou police took Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin, who was leaving to study overseas, in Wang Jianbing’s rented apartment (located at Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou) by force, and confiscated their personal belongings.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a rented apartment located in ChangZhou in Huangpu District of Guangzhou used by a friend of Wang Jianbing for storage was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police in the afternoon of September 20th. A number of personal belongings and items were taken by the police as a result.</p>\n<p>Multiple sources were able to confirmed that the main reason for Huang and Wang’s detention may be connected to the weekly friendly gatherings in Wang’s place. From September 19 to September 25, Guangzhou police have unlawfully taken some of the people who used to attend the gatherings at Wang Jianbing (Pancake)’s place into the police station. The police have asked them to corroborate the police’s theory of Huang and Wang being the organizers of political discussions and activities. These people were each held by the police for 24 hours of questioning.</p>\n<p>All of the police’s theories and allegations of Huang and Wang were completely false. According to those who have attended the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s place, Pancake is someone that is kind-hearted and selfless. The gatherings were casual in nature, as people felt safe to share about their weeks and receive emotional support from each other. The police’s allegation that Huang and Wang were plotting to commit the crime of “inciting subversion of state power” at these friendly gatherings isn’t just completely unfounded, but also unfathomable and outrageous. </p>\n<p>It has been nearly a week since their disappearance. The police refused to reveal any information about Huang and Wang to their families and friends. It became evident that the two were not detained in any detention centers in Guangdong Province. The whereabouts of the two who were suspected to be kept under “residential surveillance in a designated location” is not known to families and friends, nor are the states of their physical and mental well-beings.</p>\n<p>Families and friends of Huang and Wang strongly demand the police to disclose informations regarding their detention and release them as soon as possible! In the meantime, we demand that the police to stop the unlawful detentions and interrogations of Huang and Wang’s acquaintances at once!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Wang-and-Huang’s-bios\"><a href=\"#Wang-and-Huang’s-bios\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Wang and Huang’s bios\"></a>Wang and Huang’s bios</h2><p>Wang Jianbing (Pancake).

运动轰轰烈烈如火如荼，彼时，雪琴似利刃出鞘一般，跟进报道了好几宗#Metoo事件，比如中大张鹏性骚扰女学生的事情。报道出来后，张鹏一度表示要追究雪琴的法律责任，雪琴便写了一封公开信，喊话“承担我们各自应该承担的法律责任吧，也好为我国‘反性骚扰法’贡献一个案例和一份力量”。而那个时候我正在休养，没有参与运动中的任何行动。我不抱希望地问她要不要一见，觉得她应该不太记得我。但雪琴一口就答应了，在她开会的午休间隙，我们约在市中心的一家日本餐馆见面。雪琴还是一副快言快语的样子，告诉我，开会期间她怎么带领一帮有语言障碍的女性一起外出行动（就是觅食）。还有别的一些激动人心的收获。那天刮风降温，我出门穿少了在她开会的间隙，我在回去的公交车上瑟瑟发抖，却有些他乡重逢故人知己的喜悦和畅快，浑然不知自己把铅笔袋弄丢了。</p>\n<p>此后，我们便不曾见面，但线上偶有联系。看到她还是那样，认准了什么事就一定要做，坚决而明确。那时我还不知道，她因为深感做记者的空间有限，已决心转到法律，只记得她一直在公共平台上发声，尽记者的本分，记录、调查、报道。直到一年后（2019年）的10月中下旬，我得知她失联的消息。想起她站在明亮的舞台上、接受主流媒体的注目也就是不久之前的事，她却非要执着地做下去；转眼间，她却已被迫陷入黑暗和沉寂。这是不是“傻”？ 。朋友安慰我（这不是什么太好的安慰）：这也许是她已经反复想过的，她在迈出那一步的时候就已经设想过了这种可能。我难过至极，带着一种看见明星陨落的心情。</p>\n<p>在她第一次消失的日子里，我把她举着metoo牌子的海报贴在自己书桌前方的墙上，我一抬头就可以看见。我把这张海报的复制件贴在合租房公共空间的门上，夜里到校园贴在建筑物的墙上。我去她的社交账号上找她的照片给朋友们做海报，发现原来她在很多照片上也是穿白衬衫牛仔裤的，爽朗明快； 她跟世界各地的朋友们合影，穿着秀气的旗袍却是爽朗地笑着，一下子让人想起那天她描述自己帮一群女士出行的画面。她就是这样爽朗热情，生机勃勃的，像极了她微信上的那一大片灿烂蓬勃的野菊。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kjGLMvV.jpg\"></p>\n<center>这就是那张海报上的照片</center>\n\n<p>后来，她回来了，第一句话便是“一秒钟的黑暗不会让人成为瞎子。” 过了很久之后，我终于能跟她联系了。我搬了家，海报贴在新房间的墙上，拍给她看。她说：“谢谢你。”我扔掉了海报，觉得终于不用每天看着海报想着她怎么样了。</p>\n<p>她重获自由之后，我们继续点赞和评论之交。我仔细放大她社交媒体上的照片，却看不见她的脸上的疲惫和松垮。她给自己起名黄小懒，却始终勤奋地工作（写稿），尽管这些稿件一再地让她被喝茶、威胁。她依旧是那个执着的“傻瓜”，认准的事她便继续去做；工作之余，她又一次申请了读书，时不时地，还和朋友聚会喝酒、打麻将、爬山、泡温泉。她还时常出没在伙伴们的评论区，给她们远程发射拥抱，热情邀请她们一起。她得知我要到广州，招呼我一起喝酒、搓麻将、爬山；之后又有好几次，她在我情绪低落的po文里给我留言，还提到去煎饼家看电影放松继续邀请我。我始终因为社交恐惧和家事拖累没有成行，总觉得有些对不住她的盛情。</p>\n<p>她以前我认识的黄雪琴，就是没有架子的。哪怕像我这样只见过一两次面的人，她也能时刻敞开她内心最真诚热情的一面，热情邀请我进入她的生活，她的世界。 无论是对性骚扰的受害人，还是开会时仅仅共处即日的同行者，她也总是无条件地提供帮助，似乎没有时间和精力的“底线。在第一次遭遇指定地点监视居住的数月后，她没有变，反而越来越多地给我们这些没有经历过她遭遇的人，提供温情的鼓励。</p>\n<p><img

Wang Jianbing were arrested by police in secret at Wang's residence on September 19. For more than two weeks, the families of both parties have not received any written notification from the police, which is a serious violation of the law. Wang Jianbing's family have gone to all levels of public security bureau in Guangzhou, and the police have responded that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, but refused to inform the families of their suspected crime or what coercive measures had been taken.\n\nWang Jianbing's brother have written to and lodged complaints with to four levels of authorities, including the Guangzhou Haizhu District Xingang Police Station, the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau, the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau, asking the police to inform them in writing of the charges against Wang Jianbing and the details of the coercive measures taken against him, but have been met with refusal. In addition, the police asked the family to remain silent about the case.\n\n## [Details of the Family’s Search]\n\nOn 28 September, after repeated requests from Wang Jianbing's brother in person, the Haizhu District Xingang Police Station admitted that \"Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing had been arrested by the Guangdong Public Security Bureau\" and found a record in the public security system of the collection of information on the two persons. The record also shows Wang Jianbing underwent a Covid-19 test on 26 September. However, the police refused to inform the department handling the case, the specific coercive measures, the place of detention and other information.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TdnA0P0.png)\n\nBetween September 28 and 30, Wang Jianbing's brother attempted to file complaints to three Complaints and Proposals Offices (the Complaints and Proposals  Office of the Guangzhou Haizhu District Public Security Bureau, the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau). He requested the relevant public security departments notify Wang Jianbing’s situations in writing of the suspected crime and the compulsory measures taken as required by law. Wang’s brother also called the government hotline \"12389\" (for reporting disciplinary violations of the police), and reported the irregularities of the public security organs in not notifying the family members of the person concerned.\n\nIn the afternoon of September 30, Wang Jianbing's family called the Complaints and Proposals Offices of the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau, at that time requesting only a formal written notice of Wang’s detention. The head of that office, surnamed Liang, replied, “The section responsible for Wang Jianbing’s case is the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau,  it isn’t convenient for us to tell you the suspected crime and the specific coercive measures taken.” He also repeatedly stressed: \"The case is still being processed. Don’t go inquiring everywhere on your own. In some special cases the family is not immediately notified.\" In the face of all the excuses and illegal actions of the police at all levels, Wang Jianbing's brother went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to file a complaint, asking it to monitor the violations by the police. However, the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate responded, “Because it is impossible to determine the specifics of the case, the procuratorate cannot intervene to monitor.\"\n\nOver many days, Wang Jianbing's brother have gone to every department level of the public prosecutor and law enforcement in the region, but the family continue to have no way to knowing what crime Wang Jianbing is suspected of committing. Furthermore, the evening of September 30, they received a call from the police station in Chigang, Haizhu District, asking them to go to the police station for questioning. Wang’s brother was questioned for more than half an hour. The state security guards clearly informed the family that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but could not provide the family with any written notification, nor could they inform them of the charges or where they were currently being held. At the same time, the family was asked not to go to any more departments at any level to inquire about Wang Jianbing and to remain silent about the arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, in the afternoon of September 29, the family went to Wang Jianbing's rental apartment to check and found that the door had been replaced with a lock and the camera in front of the door had been removed. The surrounding neighbors, suspected to have been warned by the police, were tight-lipped about Wang Jianbing's situation.\n\nHalf a month has passed since the two were taken away by the police, and the family has been running around for days, but they have been unable to learn any other information except that they \"were detained by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau.\" Apparently, it is hard to imagine that the Guangzhou police will handle the case of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing legally and fairly.\n\n## [Wang and Huang’s bios]\n\nWang Jianbing (Pancake).

He was the project manager of rural education program at Western Sunshine Foundation for 5 years. In 2014, he joined GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development in Guangzhou as the project manager and coordinator of the youth development project as well as the disabled community empowerment project.

She has also participated in many #MeToo cases and campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims in sexual assault and harassment cases. Huang Xueqin was scheduled to study for a master's degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,”and was later released on bail on January 17, 2020 after being placed under \"residential surveillance in a designated location”—a form of enforced disappearance.

哪有记者不发声？\n\n文/黃雪琴\n\n媒体记者，服务于被统治者，而非统治者——The Post\n\n<!--more-->\n\n日前，我的朋友，我的同行，《新生代》的编辑危志立被消失了。他的妻子，中国“女权五姐妹”之一的郑楚然与律师从广州寻到深圳，从各级警察局问到信访办，都“查无此人”。留在郑楚然脑子里的仍是20日凌晨一点警察围进他们家里的情景，“他被带上手铐，警察留下一句‘他被洗脑了，扰乱公共秩序’，内衣内裤都不让他收拾，就抓走了。”至于通知书、拘留证据什么都没有。\n\n当日被抓的还有《新生代》的另一个编辑柯成冰，更早在1月份，主编杨郑君已经被以“寻衅滋事”罪名抓捕。抓记者，灭声音，警方已经相当娴熟。然而，记者编辑们具体做了什么事情，什么时候、在哪里、如何扰乱了秩序了公共秩序？都语焉不详。\n\n自媒体《新生代》长期关注中国内地劳工权益问题，近年来特别聚焦湖南尘肺病工人维权行动。作为该媒体的记者编辑，危志立、柯成冰等人的职责自然是跟踪报道尘肺病人工作、生活状况，深挖他们为何得了尘肺病，为何得不到应有的赔偿？\n\n研究劳工情况多年，危志立等看到了制度性的不公不义。他们眼看着不公不义继续恶性，走进劳工底层生活，用自己的行动去记录尘肺工人难以发出的声音，去帮助弱势群体争取公平与正义。撰文发声，是记者编辑的本职工作，何来寻衅滋事？对尘肺工友怀着善良之心，助其维权就是被洗了脑？难道说，只扫自家门前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜，事不关己高高挂起，在他人的兵荒马乱中岁月静好，才是正常的？帮助他们追讨用生命换来的赔偿，何错之有？他们，扰乱了什么公共秩序？哪有媒体记者不发声？\n\n要知道，自由、平等这些内容也被纳入了社会主义核心价值观中。言论自由是宪法赋予每一位公民的基本权利。发声，不是记者编辑的特有的权利，而是每一位公民应该共享的权利。\n\n自由发声，自由监督党、政府、大财团，是让人们看到制度上的不公不义，唤醒公民权利意识，并让大家觉醒，意识到这种制度上的不公不义长远来看最后会损害到我们每一个人的尊严和利益。\n\n媒体记者，服务于被统治者，而非统治者，天然背负着监督权力之使命。我们观察、记录现实，揭恶扬善，针砭时事，为无声者发声，助无力者前行。这其实不仅是记者本职，也应该是我们作为一个公民应有之觉悟。我知道，呼吁别人都站出来声讨不公不义也不公平，一是信息无法畅通传播，让大家了解多方信息以作出独立判断；二是人都有恐惧、自保之心，在毫无管控张牙舞爪的公权力下，或主动或被动地置身事外。然而，消声沉默，也是纵容。即便是服务于专制政权的警察们，或许只是在完成自己的份内工作，可是对着没有武器没有权力的记者动手动粗动暴，抓捕关押，忽视更高阶的正义，其实是一种对恶的助威和助长，终将是错的，不公义的。\n\n因为揭露权力的不公，资本的不义，因为记录并协助尘肺工人维权，因为发声而被问罪，不仅与社会主义价值观不符，还一步倒回去革命前。对媒体的高压管控与无休无止的禁令已经让真正有理想有操守的记者严重流失，濒临灭绝。2017年的《新媒体环境下中国调查记者行业生态变化报告》显示传统媒体调查记者从业人数下降幅度高达58%，全国调查记者不足200人。而洗一洗稿，舔一舔“人血馒头”，叛卖一些各种情绪的媒体则风生水起。当专制政权自以为掌握了喉舌和话语权的时候，公信力却如雪般崩塌，群众相信谣言，焦虑、气愤等情绪轻易能被点燃，人们也不再相信政府公告、报告。\n\n学者纷纷被下课，记者渐渐被消声，行动者一批批被抓，如此以往，专制政权很快会失去民心，失去了执政的正当性。当人们不再自愿服从、配合，并且有了不配合的觉醒和制衡力量，那么政权就会失去权力。但基于权力的惯性，政权有一个拼命挣扎和本能自救的阶段，这个阶段里会调动一切统治资源，使用各种统治工具，或会走向两个极端，加速毁灭或延迟寿命。专制统治难以再续。\n\n不管怎样的情况下，我们都应该抵抗媒体没落，保护言论自由。最好的抵抗和保护方式只有持续发声。既然有党管的媒体姓党，那就应该允许民间的媒体发出民间的声音。尊重并珍惜新闻自由，保障自由发声权利和渠道，重建媒体记者的信仰与信任，在当下无比珍贵和重要。\n\n即便如今乱象丛生，惊若寒蝉，我们仍看到这些年轻媒体人坚守自己的原则，勇于为不公不义发声，用实际行动与不公不义斗争，即便为此陷入铁窗之苦，承担所谓“寻衅滋事”、“扰乱秩序”罪名。人们最后会看到，他们持续发声，所作所为不为个人利益，而为阻止这个社会坏得太快烂得太透，也为更接近一点那个自由、平等的未来世界。如近日被下课的许章润教授所言，个人志向无涉公共情怀，亦无家国之思，终究苍白。做记者，哪有不发声？\n\n[原文链接](https://matters.news/@sophia/%E5%93%AA%E6%9C%89%E8%AE%B0%E8%80%85%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%91%E5%A3%B0-zdpuAyMQzhhdEq8oVr5biPmfoMET8iPF3JBEryi1muWXmKH2A)\n","source":"_posts/jizhefasheng.md","raw":"---\nlayout:

Box\"","date":"2021-10-21T02:24:09.311Z","_content":"It has been 30 days since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were secretly arrested by the Guangzhou police, but neither family nor friends have received information about them. As their friends, we can only speak out for them online. We hope to inform everyone who cares about these two individuals, about Chinese society and about human rights, that they are probably being held under 24-hour surveillance in secret, solitary confinement, and subject to interrogation under torture.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWe don't have details about what they have suffered over the past 30 days, only that the operations of police continue to be a black box, that the families' efforts have been consistently futile, and that their friends continue to be summoned for interrogation by the police.\n\n## The Arrest of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing: The Past 30 Days\n \n- [September 19] Forcibly Disappeared\n\nAround 3:00 p.m., Guangzhou police forcibly arrested Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin, who was about leave to study for a master’s degree in the UK. They were together in his rented apartment (located on Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou). Their personal belongings were seized.\n\n- [September 20] “Stability Maintenance” in Wang’s Hometown\n\nGuangzhou police, together with local police, went to Wang Jianbing’s family home for “stability maintenance”—a reference to measures used prevent action that officials consider to be politically sensitive. The authorities forbade Wang's family from seeking help from others. However, they did not provide any formal legal justifications. The authorities also failed to provide information about the circumstances leading to Wang’s arrest or the coercive measures Wang was subjected to.\n\n- [September 20] Friend’s Home Searched by Authorities\n\nAt 5:00 p.m., police broke into the rented apartment of Wang Jianbing's friend on Changzhou Island in Huangpu District (in Guangzhou). The apartment, which was used for storage, was forcibly searched by police, who broke the lock and took away a large number of items.\n\n- [September 28] Police: No Comment\n\nWang Jianbing's family inquired at Guangzhou public security departments at all levels. Only at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District were they informed that \"Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong public security.” Also, in the public security database, they discovered records for the two, including a COVID-19 test for Wang Jianbing from September 26. However, authorities at the Xingang police station refused to tell  the family which department was responsible for handling the case, what specific coercive measures had been taken, where Wang was detained, and other information.\n\n- [September 28-30] Families Submit Complaints About Lack of Access\n\nWang Jianbing's family submitted formal complaints to the respective Offices for Complaints and Proposals (xinfang) at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. They requested that, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, the public security departments notify Wang Jianbing in writing of the charges against him and the coercive measures taken. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a hotline for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violations committed by the public security authorities in not notifying the family members about the status of the person in custody. (The family has not yet received any feedback from any level; the work of Offices for Complaints and Proposals for public security departments at all levels seems to be essentially a sham.)\n\nIn the afternoon of September 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and their illegal actions at all levels, and asked the city procuratorate to monitor and intervene in the illegal actions of the police, but the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate told them: \"We can't determine the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\"\n\n- [September 30] Family Members Questioned\n\nIn the evening of September 30, Wang Jianbing's family was questioned by the Guangzhou police. Three unidentified people (suspected to be from the State Security division of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau) interrogated Wang Jianbing's family for more than half an hour without showing official authorization or providing legal justification. The suspected State Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could not provide any written notification to the family, nor could they tell us the charges or where they were currently being held.\" At the same time, the family was told to stop asking questions about Wang Jianbing at all levels and to remain silent about the incident.\n\n- [September 19 to October 18] Police Summon, Intimidate Friends\n\nDuring this period, more than 20 people believed to be friends of Huang and Wang were summoned by the Guangzhou police across the local area. They were interrogated and intimidated by police for 24 hours without any legal formalities, and some were brought in for questioning multiple times. The police asked them to provide details about gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home, and to identify participants from photos taken by nearby surveillance cameras. All signs indicate that the police are using these methods to compile a statement that will be used to impose trumped-up charges on Huang and Wang.\n\nIt is apparent from the current situation that the police have been escalating their methods of detention. They are increasingly blatant about breaking the law and openly suppressing people of social conscience making contributions to society. As recently as a few years ago, the family of the detained would at least receive official notice that their loved one was in custody. With the disappearance of Huang and Wang, their families have not received any notification regarding the status or condition of the detained, and have been unable to file effective complaints for more information for an entire month. \n\nThis is not only an attempt to fabricate trumped-up charges against Huang and Wang, but also a naked attempt to create a climate of fear and suppress every activist who speaks out for social justice.\n\nAs the friends and family of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, we will maintain a close watch over their situation!\n\n## About Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\nWang Jianbing (known to friends as “Pancake”—a Chinese homophone for Jianbing; born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master's degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master's degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n","source":"_posts/30day-en.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing Arrested 30 Days】Families Remain in Dark,\n  Friends Summoned, Police a “Black Box\"\ndate: 2021-10-21T10:24:09.311Z\ncategories:\n  - 案件通报\ntags:\n  - English\n---\nIt has been 30 days since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were secretly arrested by the Guangzhou police, but neither family nor friends have received information about them.

They were together in his rented apartment (located on Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou). Their personal belongings were seized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[September 20] “Stability Maintenance” in Wang’s Hometown</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guangzhou police, together with local police, went to Wang Jianbing’s family home for “stability maintenance”—a reference to measures used prevent action that officials consider to be politically sensitive. The authorities forbade Wang’s family from seeking help from others. However, they did not provide any formal legal justifications. The authorities also failed to provide information about the circumstances leading to Wang’s arrest or the coercive measures Wang was subjected to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[September 20] Friend’s Home Searched by Authorities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 5:00 p.m., police broke into the rented apartment of Wang Jianbing’s friend on Changzhou Island in Huangpu District (in Guangzhou). The apartment, which was used for storage, was forcibly searched by police, who broke the lock and took away a large number of items.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[September 28] Police: No Comment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wang Jianbing’s family inquired at Guangzhou public security departments at all levels. Only at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District were they informed that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong public security.” Also, in the public security database, they discovered records for the two, including a COVID-19 test for Wang Jianbing from September 26. However, authorities at the Xingang police station refused to tell  the family which department was responsible for handling the case, what specific coercive measures had been taken, where Wang was detained, and other information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[September 28-30] Families Submit Complaints About Lack of Access</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wang Jianbing’s family submitted formal complaints to the respective Offices for Complaints and Proposals (xinfang) at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. They requested that, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, the public security departments notify Wang Jianbing in writing of the charges against him and the coercive measures taken. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a hotline for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violations committed by the public security authorities in not notifying the family members about the status of the person in custody. (The family has not yet received any feedback from any level; the work of Offices for Complaints and Proposals for public security departments at all levels seems to be essentially a sham.)</p>\n<p>In the afternoon of September 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and their illegal actions at all levels, and asked the city procuratorate to monitor and intervene in the illegal actions of the police, but the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate told them: “We can’t determine the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[September 30] Family Members Questioned</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the evening of September 30, Wang Jianbing’s family was questioned by the Guangzhou police. Three unidentified people (suspected to be from the State Security division of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau) interrogated Wang Jianbing’s family for more than half an hour without showing official authorization or providing legal justification. The suspected State Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could not provide any written notification to the family, nor could they tell us the charges or where they were currently being held.” At the same time, the family was told to stop asking questions about Wang Jianbing at all levels and to remain silent about the incident.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[September 19 to October 18] Police Summon, Intimidate Friends</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During this period, more than 20 people believed to be friends of Huang and Wang were summoned by the Guangzhou police across the local area. They were interrogated and intimidated by police for 24 hours without any legal formalities, and some were brought in for questioning multiple times. The police asked them to provide details about gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home, and to identify participants from photos taken by nearby surveillance cameras. All signs indicate that the police are using these methods to compile a statement that will be used to impose trumped-up charges on Huang and Wang.</p>\n<p>It is apparent from the current situation that the police have been escalating their methods of detention. They are increasingly blatant about breaking the law and openly suppressing people of social conscience making contributions to society. As recently as a few years ago, the family of the detained would at least receive official notice that their loved one was in custody. With the disappearance of Huang and Wang, their families have not received any notification regarding the status or condition of the detained, and have been unable to file effective complaints for more information for an entire month. </p>\n<p>This is not only an attempt to fabricate trumped-up charges against Huang and Wang, but also a naked attempt to create a climate of fear and suppress every activist who speaks out for social justice.</p>\n<p>As the friends and family of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, we will maintain a close watch over their situation!</p>\n<h2 id=\"About-Huang-Xueqin-and-Wang-Jianbing\"><a href=\"#About-Huang-Xueqin-and-Wang-Jianbing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"About Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\"></a>About Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing</h2><p>Wang Jianbing (known to friends as “Pancake”—a Chinese homophone for Jianbing; born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support.

She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex.

of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士，卻再次因被捕而無法成行。\n\n<!--more-->\n\n2021年9月19日，黃雪琴同廣州職業病權益倡導者王建兵突然遭到廣州警方抓捕。警方以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權罪」於王建兵住處拘捕兩人，並疑對其採取強制措施「指定居所監視居住」，主要原因或涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚會。在家屬一再要求下，警方不僅拒絕向家屬出具通知書，亦拒絕告知兩人涉嫌罪名、採取何種強制措施等。另外，警方要求家屬對該事件保持沉默，不可與外界溝通，不得接受媒體採訪。10月26日，是兩人失聯第37天，親友仍未獲知兩人關押情況（依照中國法律，在檢察機關批准逮捕或釋放之前，公安機關可以拘留公民最長37天）。\n\n2020年10月，颱風要來了。黃雪琴打算拆掉樓下的監控攝像頭，看到手機上的惡劣天氣預警，感到開心。\n\n距離取保候審已過去半年多，但她的生活沒有恢復平靜。因為參加、記錄香港反修例運動，她被關押了三個月，並且進入了一個國保（負責中國國內安全保衞的警察）定期「訪問」的名單。除了應對警察日常騷擾，處理抓捕帶來的傷害，還要想辦法舒緩給家人造成的壓力和創傷。此外，受取保規定限制，她無法公開在被指定居所監視居住期間的經歷，這對一個堅持自由發聲記者來說，帶來的剝奪感和壓迫感比常人更甚。\n\n有天黃雪琴下樓遛狗，發現樓梯口的垃圾分類站上多了個攝像頭。她走遍了小區其它20個垃圾分類站，確定只有她家樓下有。很明顯，這攝像頭是為了她而安裝的。\n\n黃雪琴決定，要趁颱風天把這個攝像頭砸掉。\n\n「砸掉」的想法鼓舞了她的朋友們，作為用報導拉開中國#metoo運動的開端的記者，黃雪琴一直堅持透過平和理性的方式來爭取社會公義：她做獨立調查報告，書寫記錄社會不公不義，給受害者鏈接資源進行維權，發起聯名訴求，公開演講和組織培訓。朋友們認為黃雪琴的做法一直都很温和，所以當她提出要砸掉攝像頭，紛紛表示支持，甚至幫她想了很多砸掉的方式。\n\n颱風天來了又走，黃雪琴最後還是選擇了一種更「雪琴」的方式來表達抗議。她在每天出門遛狗的時候去攝像頭下舉牌「非法安裝攝像頭，要求信息公開」；她唱了首《Do you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。\n\n會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。

做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」\n\n抗爭者，這並非黃雪琴原本為自己選擇的角色。她曾是國有媒體的一員，相信體制內改良，並為此積極書寫，出謀獻策。\n\n2010年，大學畢業後，黃雪琴成為中國新聞社廣東分社的記者，後又進入《新快報》、《南都週刊》等新鋭媒體做調查記者。\n\n2000年到2015年前後，中國大陸媒體經歷了輝煌而短暫的輿論監督時期。以《南方週末》、《南方都市報》為核心的南方報業媒體是推動社會改革的傳媒主力之一：2003年《南方都市報》關於「孫志剛事件」的報導參與推動政府廢除了實施多年的「收容遣送制度」；同年該報突破當局的新聞封鎖，報導了非典疫情在廣東省內蔓延的情況，促使當局放開有關疫情的相關信息。2012年，《南都週刊》的《起底王立軍》系列文章，更是對中共高級官員的政治鬥爭進行了深度曝光。\n\n黃雪琴正是抓着這段黃金時代的尾巴進入媒體行業。那時她所在的城市——廣州，有着「中國最接近公民社會」狀態的美譽。她在每週的「市長接待日」上，記錄市民對市長的直接質問。時任廣州市長萬慶良因為一句「在珠江帝景租房子，每月交租600元」的言論，被媒體批評，一市之長淪為坊間笑談。彼時的黃雪琴認為，做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」。\n\n黃雪琴開始用手中的筆揭露社會的黑暗面，期待用報導推動社會改變。她寫的關於越南乳豬走私的調查報導，導致該地檢疫局兩名官員下台；關於深圳自閉症兒童的文章，引來相關人士對該民間機構的支持…… 那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。\n\n那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。\n\n2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。\n\n黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。\n\n肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。\n\n黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/27ec32ec024b49b591199428267448db.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n\n黃雪琴曾在中央人民廣播電台中國之聲和騰訊新聞聯合出品的特別節目《聽我說》裏講述她對抗性騷擾的故事，2019年被抓之後，視頻被下架，雪琴在網絡上的痕跡都被抹去了。圖：作者提供\n\n## 原來不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查\n\n2015年8月，天津港危化品倉庫因違規放置危化品引發爆炸，最終造成165人遇難，798人受傷。遇難的人中，有99名是消防員。\n\n那時黃雪琴剛辭了職，在美國遊學半年。看到消息，又得知國內同行被攔在現場外，她決定去紐約採訪911事件中美國消防員的救援經歷和現狀，以此對照中國消防員面臨的困境。她和國內報紙的編輯討論完後，立刻定了從西雅圖到紐約的火車票。\n\n火車上，她找到相關部門的聯絡方式，一個個發郵件說明來意，然後再一個個打電話發出採訪請求。碰釘子是經常的，受訪者反覆問她：你是誰？你屬於哪個機構？你的採訪目的是什麼？為什麼過了這麼久突然對911感興趣？雪琴回答一遍，電話轉接給另一個部門，同樣的問題又問一次，如此反覆。\n\n到了紐約，預定的民宿臨時出了狀況沒有辦法繼續住，她只好拎着行李箱在市政廳、紐約警察局、消防局、咖啡店來回跑。最後，黃雪琴終於找到了受訪者，坐在星巴克一口氣把稿子寫完，已是深夜，她看到放在身邊的行李箱，這才想起來，住宿還沒有着落。\n\n《「911」14週年，三千餘救援者確診患癌》發出後，立刻登上國內各大媒體頭條，同行都祝賀她稿子「火了」，黃雪琴沒時間看那些讚美和評論，她在紐約一家洗衣店裏，研究着怎麼洗積攢了一週的髒衣服。\n\n也是這次差點露宿街頭的經歷，黃雪琴開始對做一名獨立記者有了信心：原來她不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查。\n\n之後，黃雪琴去了柬埔寨，走進地雷村，探訪曾經的埋雷和排雷戰士，了解內戰對平民百姓的傷害；她去新加坡研究垃圾分類體系，比照調查廣州的垃圾分類現狀；她跑去越南的監獄和醫院，書寫被非洲毒販騙去販毒並被判終身監禁在異國他鄉的中國女孩的故事。\n\n這些報導之外，讓黃雪琴進一步為人熟知的，是她對性暴力案件的獨立調查報導和對中國#MeToo運動的推動。\n\n## 意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\n\n2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。\n\n黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。\n\n彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。\n\n了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。\n\n於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/8542effe438540ba9c8cc58b70321caf.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n2017年，黃雪琴發起中國女記者性騷擾調查。圖：作者提供\n\n黃雪琴就這樣和羅茜茜一起掀開了中國#MeToo運動的開端——陳小武被懲治之後，有更多高校性騷擾、公益圈性騷擾、媒體界性騷擾的事件被爆出。最高峰的時候，2018年7月，一個月裏就爆出23件性騷擾指控。倖存者出來講述遭遇的性暴力和帶來的傷害，同時要求社會作出回應，督促校園/職場出台反性騷擾機制，完善國內反性騷擾法。當時，來自94家高校的8000多名學子參與給母校寫倡議信的活動，一度形成反性騷擾風潮。\n\n深圳一高校教師、黃雪琴的好友Charlotte認為，黃雪琴在中國#MeToo運動中扮演著一個非常重要的角色，「她用人人可以理解、可以與之產生共鳴的語言講述這些女性的遭遇，讓#MeToo中的每個孤獨個體相互聯結，她寫下的每個故事，都不僅是當事人的故事，也是每位女性的故事。」\n\n黃雪琴卻自嘲自己是「矮子裏面拔高個兒」。面對性騷擾，其他記者都不敢說、不願說、不想說，自己才「意外地」成為了#MeToo運動中標誌性人物之一。\n\n深度參與#MeToo運動，為倖存者鏈接律師、心理諮詢師和其他社會資源協助維權，報導監督案件進程，原本正常不過的工作，卻令黃雪琴很快被敏感化。她供職過的媒體、供稿的平台都發來消息，說「有人在查你」。黃雪琴也開始頻繁被警察約談，要求她停止性騷擾報導，停止「煽動」學生。在高校的學生透露，校領導在一次講話中，將黃雪琴定義為「校外勢力」，要求學生遠離她。\n\n官方指責她煽動學生參與行動，連結NGO；審查刪除了她大部分的文章，她的人生歷程一點點被當局抹除和改寫。現在搜索「黃雪琴」的名字，出來的是她被捕的消息，和零星的#MeToo報導，她曾經引以為傲的、帶來些許改變的那些文字，那段她最充實的時光，都被這個有效率、強大的審查機器無情地清除了。\n\n她的一位同行、一外國媒體駐中國的記者Anne說，黃雪琴推動中國高校建立反性騷擾機制方式「不是對抗性的，而是合作的方式」，告訴校方建立這個機制對他們來說有什麼好處，是想一起解決性騷擾問題。\n\n彼時高校性騷擾機制的建立還遙遙無期，但Anne說黃雪琴「總是很樂觀」。\n\n樂觀體現在生活中。雪琴有次和朋友去旅行，半路車壞了，深夜裏幾個人沒有東西吃，沒有地方住，大家都沮喪時，雪琴突然叫起來，「啊，你們看，今晚的星星好漂亮啊！」\n\n不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動\n這種樂觀延續到了警察開始騷擾她與家人之後。2019年9月本是黃雪琴赴香港大學攻讀法律碩士的時間。但在此之前，廣東國保因為她發布關於香港反修例運動的文章，關押她24小時，沒收了她的護照，阻止她留學。\n\n她不是不鬱悶，畢竟學校和獎學金也不容易申請。但她隨即又想開了，不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動。然而情況持續惡化。2019年10月17日，黃雪琴在國保的要求下去到警察局，此前他們聲稱會歸還雪琴的護照，卻沒料到，這是一次誘捕。\n\n一開始，黃雪琴被關押在看守所。起初，她把看守所的日子當作人類學的田野調查，她傾聽她們的故事，還想為她們寫書，書名都想好了，就叫《女子監獄A101》。101是她所在的監室。\n\n![9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/6e2356d20be34477a6f7480fd089ac64.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。圖：作者提供\n後來被指定居所監視居住，日子就不那麼好過了。藝術家艾未未也曾被監視居住，他做過一場展覽，還原被指定居所監視居住的生活情況。在一個無人知曉的地方，見不到律師和家屬，完全與外人斷絕接觸。在窄小的空間裏，除了不規則的審問，至少有兩個人每天24小時站在身邊，記錄下你的所有動作和表情，伸幾次懶腰，吃幾口飯，喝幾杯水，上廁所、洗澡、睡覺，天天如此。\n\n在如此沒有隱私、備受壓迫的環境下，雪琴還同情看守人員，她們在她上完廁所後，還要去確定她的大便是軟的還是硬的；她們在她睡着時，要記錄她翻身的次數。沒有人可以交談，她只能在狹小的房間裏散步，一邊讓自己的思緒飄到遠方，她試着想像，小王子後來遇到的玫瑰園中那5000朵玫瑰，每一朵都是什麼樣，和小王子鍾愛的那朵有什麼不同。\n\n這種有些浪漫樂觀的情緒，似乎在經歷過生活摧折的人身上並不多見。黃雪琴說，之所以能夠坦然地接受自己的際遇，是因為作為記者，她讀過、看過、聽過、寫過太多他人的遭遇：寧為玉碎的林昭，精神獨立的陳寅恪，那些奔向廣場又回不來的年輕人。\n\n這讓黃雪琴得到了安慰和力量。她也剖析，這也可能是一種逃避。實際上，從2018年開始，她就會時不時陷入一種「失語」狀態。某一段時間，她會什麼都不想說，什麼都無力做，被一種巨大的虛無和絕望籠罩。\n\n或許2019年是個喘息機會，入學前，黃雪琴在香港大學訪學。誰也沒料到，反修例運動就在此時爆發了。\n\n## 「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\n\n6月9日，為了反對修訂逃犯條例，100多萬香港人走上街頭，用和平遊行的方式表達反對態度。在社會運動的歷史現場，黃雪琴帶着要去「發聲、參與、見證並記錄」的心態，加入了最初的遊行。\n\n她跟着人群走，一邊在朋友圈發着現場的照片和視頻，卻發現相關內容不斷被屏蔽刪除。香港運動成為敏感度最高的話題。在大陸，一切關於反修例運動的信息都會受到審查，當局開動宣傳機器，稱抗爭者「與境外勢力勾結」，用暴力反對一國兩制，是「港獨」、「暴徒」。\n\n黃雪琴在現場看到這些官方敘事中的「暴徒」是如何有序地參與遊行，如何有禮貌地給彼此讓路，又如何使用和理非方式表達自己；也看到官方宣傳污名化、妖魔化運動後導致的輿論撕裂，她更明白真實記錄的重要。視頻照片發不出去，她就發文字「七分之一的香港人走上街頭，反對惡法」。朋友們看到了來問她「香港發生了什麼？反對什麼惡法？為什麼反對？」，她都一一耐心解釋。\n\n後來，微博、微信上關於這場抗爭的痕跡被抹去，她自己的賬號也被禁言，官方媒體只允許「暴徒亂港」一種定論，她感覺這場運動會像30年前北京天安門那場運動一樣被國家機器抹除、改寫，一種使命感和責任感湧上來，她要承擔起一位記者的責任，要記錄下歷史的碎片，要盡力還原現場真實的聲音，抱着這樣一種心情，她實名寫下了那篇《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》，正是這篇文章直接讓她陷入牢獄之災。\n\n文章發出來的第二天深夜，警察便去到她廣州的家裏找她的家人，要求黃雪琴「閉嘴」。之後，黃雪琴返回大陸家中當晚，就被抓了。\n\n按照同行Anne的話說，「除了履行作為記者的職責報導香港反送中運動之外，她什麼都沒有做」。\n\n黃雪琴考慮過後果，深思熟慮後，她認為自己做不到不去記錄，對她來說，那是記者，尤其是在場的記者的失職。正如《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》文章最後所說，「親身經歷了，見證了，就不能假裝無知，不能放棄記錄，不能坐而待斃。黑暗無邊，僅剩的一絲真實和亮光，絕對不能拱手相讓。」\n\n「一秒鐘的黑暗不會讓人成為瞎子」——在被關押的黑暗的時間中，也是這句話給了黃雪琴力量。\n\n國家暴力機關對待異見者、行動者一般是先展現「鐵拳」和暴力，然後是漫長的關押，教育，轉化。對被監禁者而言，最初的恐嚇與威脅慢慢失效，後來的敵人，變成了漫長無盡頭的時光。\n\n黃雪琴無數次地回憶曾讀過的書，去過的地方，遇到過的人，保持讓思維的運轉。面對長期的轉化教育，她把自己想像成一個女特務。女特務不像女英雄，永遠慷慨激昂，在那種環境裏，用本色去應對會很快被消耗。女特務懂得斡旋，她聰明、狡猾，在保護自己的同時，也不會忘記自己的使命。\n\n但黃雪琴又對這套「把自己想像成一個女特務」的方式非常警惕，因為這樣就達到了轉化教育的目的：讓真誠的人變得沉默、逢場作戲、表裏不一。她厭惡這種做法，她喜歡坐在草地上和身邊的人暢談。坦誠、真實，對她來說非常重要。\n\n曾經在2020年參與聲援黃雪琴的小北，初次見面便覺得她是個特別有原則的人。當時他們分組玩遊戲，規則是，如果每組都選擇同一個數字，便都可以獲得加分，如果其中一組和其它組選的不一樣，則選擇不一樣的組可以加分，其它相同選擇的組要扣分。組與組之間可以交談，以協商或欺騙的方式說服對方，最後哪個組得到最高分，哪個組獲勝。\n\n一場遊戲中的爾虞我詐開始了。有些組為了勝利而選擇拉攏、欺騙。但黃雪琴堅持認為，大家一定要共贏，建立彼此信任的夥伴關係，不能被遊戲規則操弄。小北說，雪琴當時非常激動，說到最後甚至哭了出來。\n\n對黃雪琴來說，保持敏感，保持對痛苦和憤怒的感知才能在這個荒謬時代中，做一個更好的記者。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/2ed6ce558eb848c9a4aeb0f4af6e4968.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/1467/format/jpg)\n\n2021年秋，黃雪琴獲得英國志奮領獎學金支持，原計劃於9月20日前往薩塞克斯大學（University of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士。圖：作者提供\n\n## 「哪有記者不發聲」\n\n取保候審出來後，黃雪琴有時會做噩夢。有一次她夢到自己又被關進監獄，夢裏有一位暴君，不知為何暴怒要蒸煮犯人吃，卻又覺得犯人太低賤，便煮了一個大臣，吃到手指發現還有戒指遺留在上面，暴君大怒，又要繼續吃人。雪琴在夢裏又驚又怒，要出去聲討暴君，卻被家人捂住嘴，「吃的又不是你，別瞎操心，不準喊」。雪琴驚醒了。她想起被消失的公民記者張展、陳秋實、李澤華。\n\n她不斷提醒自己，不要陷入自我感動。相比很多人，她的生活沒有被毀，她沒有遭遇身體酷刑，沒有太多的創傷，貓狗雙全，有空和朋友去喝小酒。已經是很大的幸運了。她依然願意把精力放在觀察和記錄這個荒謬時代，以及在時代中掙扎的人。\n\n當然，牢獄之災在她身上留下痕跡。警察的騷擾和監控仍在繼續，她不能離開廣州，她害怕自家小狗的叫聲，因為每次國保突然來訪，她的狗都會狂吠不止。\n\n儘管她被要求不能公開講述自己在裏面的經歷，但保釋幾個月後，黃雪琴終於可以拿起筆寫日記，並分享給少數朋友。據她的朋友透露，她日記裏清晰記錄着，國保如何刺激她，監控她，阻撓她正常工作，通過記錄，雪琴一點點找回了自己的力量。\n\n「哪有記者不發聲」，這是她寫過的文章標題。她堅持着報導和記錄，只是只能以匿名的形式發表文章。她採訪寫作的女性抗爭者李翹楚，獲得了2021年SOPA「卓越女性議題報道獎」金獎。只是沒有想到，她又一次步入了和她們類似的命運。\n\n採訪的最後，我問她，你理想中的社會是什麼樣？\n\n她說，是「群魔亂舞」的，每個人都可以自然地自由地生長，有人做妖孽，有人做鬥士，要像一個百草花園，盛開着各種各樣的花朵。\n\n我問，那你在其中的角色呢？\n\n她毫不猶豫，「我是那個記錄者，我會拿着我的筆、我的鏡頭把每一朵花如何生長、盛開、凋零都記錄下來。」然後她補充了一句，「當然，我自己也要盛開。」\n\n####

媒体报道\n---\n【編者按】：本文由端傳媒與NGOCN聲音計劃聯合出品，首發於端傳媒。\n\n黃雪琴，中國獨立調查記者，女權行動者。曾任職《新快報》、《南都週刊》等國有媒體，後辭職成為獨立記者。2018年，她深度參與推動中國#MeToo運動，支持多例個案維權，並發起一系列反性騷擾行動。2019年，她在香港參加反修例遊行並實名發表記錄文章，因此被中國當局以「尋釁滋事罪」刑事拘留，並被採取強制措施「指定地點監視居住」3個月，原定於當年9月入讀港大法學系碩士項目，也因被捕而無法前往。2020年1月17日她被取保候審。2021年秋，黃雪琴獲得英國志奮領獎學金支持，原計劃於9月20日赴薩塞克斯大學（University

Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士，卻再次因被捕而無法成行。\n\n<!--more-->\n\n2021年9月19日，黃雪琴同廣州職業病權益倡導者王建兵突然遭到廣州警方抓捕。警方以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權罪」於王建兵住處拘捕兩人，並疑對其採取強制措施「指定居所監視居住」，主要原因或涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚會。在家屬一再要求下，警方不僅拒絕向家屬出具通知書，亦拒絕告知兩人涉嫌罪名、採取何種強制措施等。另外，警方要求家屬對該事件保持沉默，不可與外界溝通，不得接受媒體採訪。10月26日，是兩人失聯第37天，親友仍未獲知兩人關押情況（依照中國法律，在檢察機關批准逮捕或釋放之前，公安機關可以拘留公民最長37天）。\n\n2020年10月，颱風要來了。黃雪琴打算拆掉樓下的監控攝像頭，看到手機上的惡劣天氣預警，感到開心。\n\n距離取保候審已過去半年多，但她的生活沒有恢復平靜。因為參加、記錄香港反修例運動，她被關押了三個月，並且進入了一個國保（負責中國國內安全保衞的警察）定期「訪問」的名單。除了應對警察日常騷擾，處理抓捕帶來的傷害，還要想辦法舒緩給家人造成的壓力和創傷。此外，受取保規定限制，她無法公開在被指定居所監視居住期間的經歷，這對一個堅持自由發聲記者來說，帶來的剝奪感和壓迫感比常人更甚。\n\n有天黃雪琴下樓遛狗，發現樓梯口的垃圾分類站上多了個攝像頭。她走遍了小區其它20個垃圾分類站，確定只有她家樓下有。很明顯，這攝像頭是為了她而安裝的。\n\n黃雪琴決定，要趁颱風天把這個攝像頭砸掉。\n\n「砸掉」的想法鼓舞了她的朋友們，作為用報導拉開中國#metoo運動的開端的記者，黃雪琴一直堅持透過平和理性的方式來爭取社會公義：她做獨立調查報告，書寫記錄社會不公不義，給受害者鏈接資源進行維權，發起聯名訴求，公開演講和組織培訓。朋友們認為黃雪琴的做法一直都很温和，所以當她提出要砸掉攝像頭，紛紛表示支持，甚至幫她想了很多砸掉的方式。\n\n颱風天來了又走，黃雪琴最後還是選擇了一種更「雪琴」的方式來表達抗議。她在每天出門遛狗的時候去攝像頭下舉牌「非法安裝攝像頭，要求信息公開」；她唱了首《Do you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。\n\n會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。

做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」\n\n抗爭者，這並非黃雪琴原本為自己選擇的角色。她曾是國有媒體的一員，相信體制內改良，並為此積極書寫，出謀獻策。\n\n2010年，大學畢業後，黃雪琴成為中國新聞社廣東分社的記者，後又進入《新快報》、《南都週刊》等新鋭媒體做調查記者。\n\n2000年到2015年前後，中國大陸媒體經歷了輝煌而短暫的輿論監督時期。以《南方週末》、《南方都市報》為核心的南方報業媒體是推動社會改革的傳媒主力之一：2003年《南方都市報》關於「孫志剛事件」的報導參與推動政府廢除了實施多年的「收容遣送制度」；同年該報突破當局的新聞封鎖，報導了非典疫情在廣東省內蔓延的情況，促使當局放開有關疫情的相關信息。2012年，《南都週刊》的《起底王立軍》系列文章，更是對中共高級官員的政治鬥爭進行了深度曝光。\n\n黃雪琴正是抓着這段黃金時代的尾巴進入媒體行業。那時她所在的城市——廣州，有着「中國最接近公民社會」狀態的美譽。她在每週的「市長接待日」上，記錄市民對市長的直接質問。時任廣州市長萬慶良因為一句「在珠江帝景租房子，每月交租600元」的言論，被媒體批評，一市之長淪為坊間笑談。彼時的黃雪琴認為，做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」。\n\n黃雪琴開始用手中的筆揭露社會的黑暗面，期待用報導推動社會改變。她寫的關於越南乳豬走私的調查報導，導致該地檢疫局兩名官員下台；關於深圳自閉症兒童的文章，引來相關人士對該民間機構的支持…… 那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。\n\n那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。\n\n2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。\n\n黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。\n\n肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。\n\n黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/27ec32ec024b49b591199428267448db.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n\n黃雪琴曾在中央人民廣播電台中國之聲和騰訊新聞聯合出品的特別節目《聽我說》裏講述她對抗性騷擾的故事，2019年被抓之後，視頻被下架，雪琴在網絡上的痕跡都被抹去了。圖：作者提供\n\n## 原來不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查\n\n2015年8月，天津港危化品倉庫因違規放置危化品引發爆炸，最終造成165人遇難，798人受傷。遇難的人中，有99名是消防員。\n\n那時黃雪琴剛辭了職，在美國遊學半年。看到消息，又得知國內同行被攔在現場外，她決定去紐約採訪911事件中美國消防員的救援經歷和現狀，以此對照中國消防員面臨的困境。她和國內報紙的編輯討論完後，立刻定了從西雅圖到紐約的火車票。\n\n火車上，她找到相關部門的聯絡方式，一個個發郵件說明來意，然後再一個個打電話發出採訪請求。碰釘子是經常的，受訪者反覆問她：你是誰？你屬於哪個機構？你的採訪目的是什麼？為什麼過了這麼久突然對911感興趣？雪琴回答一遍，電話轉接給另一個部門，同樣的問題又問一次，如此反覆。\n\n到了紐約，預定的民宿臨時出了狀況沒有辦法繼續住，她只好拎着行李箱在市政廳、紐約警察局、消防局、咖啡店來回跑。最後，黃雪琴終於找到了受訪者，坐在星巴克一口氣把稿子寫完，已是深夜，她看到放在身邊的行李箱，這才想起來，住宿還沒有着落。\n\n《「911」14週年，三千餘救援者確診患癌》發出後，立刻登上國內各大媒體頭條，同行都祝賀她稿子「火了」，黃雪琴沒時間看那些讚美和評論，她在紐約一家洗衣店裏，研究着怎麼洗積攢了一週的髒衣服。\n\n也是這次差點露宿街頭的經歷，黃雪琴開始對做一名獨立記者有了信心：原來她不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查。\n\n之後，黃雪琴去了柬埔寨，走進地雷村，探訪曾經的埋雷和排雷戰士，了解內戰對平民百姓的傷害；她去新加坡研究垃圾分類體系，比照調查廣州的垃圾分類現狀；她跑去越南的監獄和醫院，書寫被非洲毒販騙去販毒並被判終身監禁在異國他鄉的中國女孩的故事。\n\n這些報導之外，讓黃雪琴進一步為人熟知的，是她對性暴力案件的獨立調查報導和對中國#MeToo運動的推動。\n\n## 意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\n\n2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。\n\n黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。\n\n彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。\n\n了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。\n\n於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/8542effe438540ba9c8cc58b70321caf.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n2017年，黃雪琴發起中國女記者性騷擾調查。圖：作者提供\n\n黃雪琴就這樣和羅茜茜一起掀開了中國#MeToo運動的開端——陳小武被懲治之後，有更多高校性騷擾、公益圈性騷擾、媒體界性騷擾的事件被爆出。最高峰的時候，2018年7月，一個月裏就爆出23件性騷擾指控。倖存者出來講述遭遇的性暴力和帶來的傷害，同時要求社會作出回應，督促校園/職場出台反性騷擾機制，完善國內反性騷擾法。當時，來自94家高校的8000多名學子參與給母校寫倡議信的活動，一度形成反性騷擾風潮。\n\n深圳一高校教師、黃雪琴的好友Charlotte認為，黃雪琴在中國#MeToo運動中扮演著一個非常重要的角色，「她用人人可以理解、可以與之產生共鳴的語言講述這些女性的遭遇，讓#MeToo中的每個孤獨個體相互聯結，她寫下的每個故事，都不僅是當事人的故事，也是每位女性的故事。」\n\n黃雪琴卻自嘲自己是「矮子裏面拔高個兒」。面對性騷擾，其他記者都不敢說、不願說、不想說，自己才「意外地」成為了#MeToo運動中標誌性人物之一。\n\n深度參與#MeToo運動，為倖存者鏈接律師、心理諮詢師和其他社會資源協助維權，報導監督案件進程，原本正常不過的工作，卻令黃雪琴很快被敏感化。她供職過的媒體、供稿的平台都發來消息，說「有人在查你」。黃雪琴也開始頻繁被警察約談，要求她停止性騷擾報導，停止「煽動」學生。在高校的學生透露，校領導在一次講話中，將黃雪琴定義為「校外勢力」，要求學生遠離她。\n\n官方指責她煽動學生參與行動，連結NGO；審查刪除了她大部分的文章，她的人生歷程一點點被當局抹除和改寫。現在搜索「黃雪琴」的名字，出來的是她被捕的消息，和零星的#MeToo報導，她曾經引以為傲的、帶來些許改變的那些文字，那段她最充實的時光，都被這個有效率、強大的審查機器無情地清除了。\n\n她的一位同行、一外國媒體駐中國的記者Anne說，黃雪琴推動中國高校建立反性騷擾機制方式「不是對抗性的，而是合作的方式」，告訴校方建立這個機制對他們來說有什麼好處，是想一起解決性騷擾問題。\n\n彼時高校性騷擾機制的建立還遙遙無期，但Anne說黃雪琴「總是很樂觀」。\n\n樂觀體現在生活中。雪琴有次和朋友去旅行，半路車壞了，深夜裏幾個人沒有東西吃，沒有地方住，大家都沮喪時，雪琴突然叫起來，「啊，你們看，今晚的星星好漂亮啊！」\n\n不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動\n這種樂觀延續到了警察開始騷擾她與家人之後。2019年9月本是黃雪琴赴香港大學攻讀法律碩士的時間。但在此之前，廣東國保因為她發布關於香港反修例運動的文章，關押她24小時，沒收了她的護照，阻止她留學。\n\n她不是不鬱悶，畢竟學校和獎學金也不容易申請。但她隨即又想開了，不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動。然而情況持續惡化。2019年10月17日，黃雪琴在國保的要求下去到警察局，此前他們聲稱會歸還雪琴的護照，卻沒料到，這是一次誘捕。\n\n一開始，黃雪琴被關押在看守所。起初，她把看守所的日子當作人類學的田野調查，她傾聽她們的故事，還想為她們寫書，書名都想好了，就叫《女子監獄A101》。101是她所在的監室。\n\n![9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/6e2356d20be34477a6f7480fd089ac64.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。圖：作者提供\n後來被指定居所監視居住，日子就不那麼好過了。藝術家艾未未也曾被監視居住，他做過一場展覽，還原被指定居所監視居住的生活情況。在一個無人知曉的地方，見不到律師和家屬，完全與外人斷絕接觸。在窄小的空間裏，除了不規則的審問，至少有兩個人每天24小時站在身邊，記錄下你的所有動作和表情，伸幾次懶腰，吃幾口飯，喝幾杯水，上廁所、洗澡、睡覺，天天如此。\n\n在如此沒有隱私、備受壓迫的環境下，雪琴還同情看守人員，她們在她上完廁所後，還要去確定她的大便是軟的還是硬的；她們在她睡着時，要記錄她翻身的次數。沒有人可以交談，她只能在狹小的房間裏散步，一邊讓自己的思緒飄到遠方，她試着想像，小王子後來遇到的玫瑰園中那5000朵玫瑰，每一朵都是什麼樣，和小王子鍾愛的那朵有什麼不同。\n\n這種有些浪漫樂觀的情緒，似乎在經歷過生活摧折的人身上並不多見。黃雪琴說，之所以能夠坦然地接受自己的際遇，是因為作為記者，她讀過、看過、聽過、寫過太多他人的遭遇：寧為玉碎的林昭，精神獨立的陳寅恪，那些奔向廣場又回不來的年輕人。\n\n這讓黃雪琴得到了安慰和力量。她也剖析，這也可能是一種逃避。實際上，從2018年開始，她就會時不時陷入一種「失語」狀態。某一段時間，她會什麼都不想說，什麼都無力做，被一種巨大的虛無和絕望籠罩。\n\n或許2019年是個喘息機會，入學前，黃雪琴在香港大學訪學。誰也沒料到，反修例運動就在此時爆發了。\n\n## 「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\n\n6月9日，為了反對修訂逃犯條例，100多萬香港人走上街頭，用和平遊行的方式表達反對態度。在社會運動的歷史現場，黃雪琴帶着要去「發聲、參與、見證並記錄」的心態，加入了最初的遊行。\n\n她跟着人群走，一邊在朋友圈發着現場的照片和視頻，卻發現相關內容不斷被屏蔽刪除。香港運動成為敏感度最高的話題。在大陸，一切關於反修例運動的信息都會受到審查，當局開動宣傳機器，稱抗爭者「與境外勢力勾結」，用暴力反對一國兩制，是「港獨」、「暴徒」。\n\n黃雪琴在現場看到這些官方敘事中的「暴徒」是如何有序地參與遊行，如何有禮貌地給彼此讓路，又如何使用和理非方式表達自己；也看到官方宣傳污名化、妖魔化運動後導致的輿論撕裂，她更明白真實記錄的重要。視頻照片發不出去，她就發文字「七分之一的香港人走上街頭，反對惡法」。朋友們看到了來問她「香港發生了什麼？反對什麼惡法？為什麼反對？」，她都一一耐心解釋。\n\n後來，微博、微信上關於這場抗爭的痕跡被抹去，她自己的賬號也被禁言，官方媒體只允許「暴徒亂港」一種定論，她感覺這場運動會像30年前北京天安門那場運動一樣被國家機器抹除、改寫，一種使命感和責任感湧上來，她要承擔起一位記者的責任，要記錄下歷史的碎片，要盡力還原現場真實的聲音，抱着這樣一種心情，她實名寫下了那篇《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》，正是這篇文章直接讓她陷入牢獄之災。\n\n文章發出來的第二天深夜，警察便去到她廣州的家裏找她的家人，要求黃雪琴「閉嘴」。之後，黃雪琴返回大陸家中當晚，就被抓了。\n\n按照同行Anne的話說，「除了履行作為記者的職責報導香港反送中運動之外，她什麼都沒有做」。\n\n黃雪琴考慮過後果，深思熟慮後，她認為自己做不到不去記錄，對她來說，那是記者，尤其是在場的記者的失職。正如《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》文章最後所說，「親身經歷了，見證了，就不能假裝無知，不能放棄記錄，不能坐而待斃。黑暗無邊，僅剩的一絲真實和亮光，絕對不能拱手相讓。」\n\n「一秒鐘的黑暗不會讓人成為瞎子」——在被關押的黑暗的時間中，也是這句話給了黃雪琴力量。\n\n國家暴力機關對待異見者、行動者一般是先展現「鐵拳」和暴力，然後是漫長的關押，教育，轉化。對被監禁者而言，最初的恐嚇與威脅慢慢失效，後來的敵人，變成了漫長無盡頭的時光。\n\n黃雪琴無數次地回憶曾讀過的書，去過的地方，遇到過的人，保持讓思維的運轉。面對長期的轉化教育，她把自己想像成一個女特務。女特務不像女英雄，永遠慷慨激昂，在那種環境裏，用本色去應對會很快被消耗。女特務懂得斡旋，她聰明、狡猾，在保護自己的同時，也不會忘記自己的使命。\n\n但黃雪琴又對這套「把自己想像成一個女特務」的方式非常警惕，因為這樣就達到了轉化教育的目的：讓真誠的人變得沉默、逢場作戲、表裏不一。她厭惡這種做法，她喜歡坐在草地上和身邊的人暢談。坦誠、真實，對她來說非常重要。\n\n曾經在2020年參與聲援黃雪琴的小北，初次見面便覺得她是個特別有原則的人。當時他們分組玩遊戲，規則是，如果每組都選擇同一個數字，便都可以獲得加分，如果其中一組和其它組選的不一樣，則選擇不一樣的組可以加分，其它相同選擇的組要扣分。組與組之間可以交談，以協商或欺騙的方式說服對方，最後哪個組得到最高分，哪個組獲勝。\n\n一場遊戲中的爾虞我詐開始了。有些組為了勝利而選擇拉攏、欺騙。但黃雪琴堅持認為，大家一定要共贏，建立彼此信任的夥伴關係，不能被遊戲規則操弄。小北說，雪琴當時非常激動，說到最後甚至哭了出來。\n\n對黃雪琴來說，保持敏感，保持對痛苦和憤怒的感知才能在這個荒謬時代中，做一個更好的記者。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/2ed6ce558eb848c9a4aeb0f4af6e4968.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/1467/format/jpg)\n\n2021年秋，黃雪琴獲得英國志奮領獎學金支持，原計劃於9月20日前往薩塞克斯大學（University of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士。圖：作者提供\n\n## 「哪有記者不發聲」\n\n取保候審出來後，黃雪琴有時會做噩夢。有一次她夢到自己又被關進監獄，夢裏有一位暴君，不知為何暴怒要蒸煮犯人吃，卻又覺得犯人太低賤，便煮了一個大臣，吃到手指發現還有戒指遺留在上面，暴君大怒，又要繼續吃人。雪琴在夢裏又驚又怒，要出去聲討暴君，卻被家人捂住嘴，「吃的又不是你，別瞎操心，不準喊」。雪琴驚醒了。她想起被消失的公民記者張展、陳秋實、李澤華。\n\n她不斷提醒自己，不要陷入自我感動。相比很多人，她的生活沒有被毀，她沒有遭遇身體酷刑，沒有太多的創傷，貓狗雙全，有空和朋友去喝小酒。已經是很大的幸運了。她依然願意把精力放在觀察和記錄這個荒謬時代，以及在時代中掙扎的人。\n\n當然，牢獄之災在她身上留下痕跡。警察的騷擾和監控仍在繼續，她不能離開廣州，她害怕自家小狗的叫聲，因為每次國保突然來訪，她的狗都會狂吠不止。\n\n儘管她被要求不能公開講述自己在裏面的經歷，但保釋幾個月後，黃雪琴終於可以拿起筆寫日記，並分享給少數朋友。據她的朋友透露，她日記裏清晰記錄着，國保如何刺激她，監控她，阻撓她正常工作，通過記錄，雪琴一點點找回了自己的力量。\n\n「哪有記者不發聲」，這是她寫過的文章標題。她堅持着報導和記錄，只是只能以匿名的形式發表文章。她採訪寫作的女性抗爭者李翹楚，獲得了2021年SOPA「卓越女性議題報道獎」金獎。只是沒有想到，她又一次步入了和她們類似的命運。\n\n採訪的最後，我問她，你理想中的社會是什麼樣？\n\n她說，是「群魔亂舞」的，每個人都可以自然地自由地生長，有人做妖孽，有人做鬥士，要像一個百草花園，盛開着各種各樣的花朵。\n\n我問，那你在其中的角色呢？\n\n她毫不猶豫，「我是那個記錄者，我會拿着我的筆、我的鏡頭把每一朵花如何生長、盛開、凋零都記錄下來。」然後她補充了一句，「當然，我自己也要盛開。」\n\n####

id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<p>2021年9月19日，黃雪琴同廣州職業病權益倡導者王建兵突然遭到廣州警方抓捕。警方以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權罪」於王建兵住處拘捕兩人，並疑對其採取強制措施「指定居所監視居住」，主要原因或涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚會。在家屬一再要求下，警方不僅拒絕向家屬出具通知書，亦拒絕告知兩人涉嫌罪名、採取何種強制措施等。另外，警方要求家屬對該事件保持沉默，不可與外界溝通，不得接受媒體採訪。10月26日，是兩人失聯第37天，親友仍未獲知兩人關押情況（依照中國法律，在檢察機關批准逮捕或釋放之前，公安機關可以拘留公民最長37天）。</p>\n<p>2020年10月，颱風要來了。黃雪琴打算拆掉樓下的監控攝像頭，看到手機上的惡劣天氣預警，感到開心。</p>\n<p>距離取保候審已過去半年多，但她的生活沒有恢復平靜。因為參加、記錄香港反修例運動，她被關押了三個月，並且進入了一個國保（負責中國國內安全保衞的警察）定期「訪問」的名單。除了應對警察日常騷擾，處理抓捕帶來的傷害，還要想辦法舒緩給家人造成的壓力和創傷。此外，受取保規定限制，她無法公開在被指定居所監視居住期間的經歷，這對一個堅持自由發聲記者來說，帶來的剝奪感和壓迫感比常人更甚。</p>\n<p>有天黃雪琴下樓遛狗，發現樓梯口的垃圾分類站上多了個攝像頭。她走遍了小區其它20個垃圾分類站，確定只有她家樓下有。很明顯，這攝像頭是為了她而安裝的。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴決定，要趁颱風天把這個攝像頭砸掉。</p>\n<p>「砸掉」的想法鼓舞了她的朋友們，作為用報導拉開中國#metoo運動的開端的記者，黃雪琴一直堅持透過平和理性的方式來爭取社會公義：她做獨立調查報告，書寫記錄社會不公不義，給受害者鏈接資源進行維權，發起聯名訴求，公開演講和組織培訓。朋友們認為黃雪琴的做法一直都很温和，所以當她提出要砸掉攝像頭，紛紛表示支持，甚至幫她想了很多砸掉的方式。</p>\n<p>颱風天來了又走，黃雪琴最後還是選擇了一種更「雪琴」的方式來表達抗議。她在每天出門遛狗的時候去攝像頭下舉牌「非法安裝攝像頭，要求信息公開」；她唱了首《Do you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。</p>\n<p>會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。  </p>\n<p><img

那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。</p>\n<p>那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。</p>\n<p>2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。</p>\n<p>肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。</p>\n<p><img

id=\"意外成為中國-MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\"><a href=\"#意外成為中國-MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\"></a>意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一</h2><p>2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。</p>\n<p>彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。</p>\n<p>了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。</p>\n<p>於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。</p>\n<p><img

id=\"「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\"><a href=\"#「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\"></a>「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」</h2><p>6月9日，為了反對修訂逃犯條例，100多萬香港人走上街頭，用和平遊行的方式表達反對態度。在社會運動的歷史現場，黃雪琴帶着要去「發聲、參與、見證並記錄」的心態，加入了最初的遊行。</p>\n<p>她跟着人群走，一邊在朋友圈發着現場的照片和視頻，卻發現相關內容不斷被屏蔽刪除。香港運動成為敏感度最高的話題。在大陸，一切關於反修例運動的信息都會受到審查，當局開動宣傳機器，稱抗爭者「與境外勢力勾結」，用暴力反對一國兩制，是「港獨」、「暴徒」。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴在現場看到這些官方敘事中的「暴徒」是如何有序地參與遊行，如何有禮貌地給彼此讓路，又如何使用和理非方式表達自己；也看到官方宣傳污名化、妖魔化運動後導致的輿論撕裂，她更明白真實記錄的重要。視頻照片發不出去，她就發文字「七分之一的香港人走上街頭，反對惡法」。朋友們看到了來問她「香港發生了什麼？反對什麼惡法？為什麼反對？」，她都一一耐心解釋。</p>\n<p>後來，微博、微信上關於這場抗爭的痕跡被抹去，她自己的賬號也被禁言，官方媒體只允許「暴徒亂港」一種定論，她感覺這場運動會像30年前北京天安門那場運動一樣被國家機器抹除、改寫，一種使命感和責任感湧上來，她要承擔起一位記者的責任，要記錄下歷史的碎片，要盡力還原現場真實的聲音，抱着這樣一種心情，她實名寫下了那篇《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》，正是這篇文章直接讓她陷入牢獄之災。</p>\n<p>文章發出來的第二天深夜，警察便去到她廣州的家裏找她的家人，要求黃雪琴「閉嘴」。之後，黃雪琴返回大陸家中當晚，就被抓了。</p>\n<p>按照同行Anne的話說，「除了履行作為記者的職責報導香港反送中運動之外，她什麼都沒有做」。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴考慮過後果，深思熟慮後，她認為自己做不到不去記錄，對她來說，那是記者，尤其是在場的記者的失職。正如《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》文章最後所說，「親身經歷了，見證了，就不能假裝無知，不能放棄記錄，不能坐而待斃。黑暗無邊，僅剩的一絲真實和亮光，絕對不能拱手相讓。」</p>\n<p>「一秒鐘的黑暗不會讓人成為瞎子」——在被關押的黑暗的時間中，也是這句話給了黃雪琴力量。</p>\n<p>國家暴力機關對待異見者、行動者一般是先展現「鐵拳」和暴力，然後是漫長的關押，教育，轉化。對被監禁者而言，最初的恐嚇與威脅慢慢失效，後來的敵人，變成了漫長無盡頭的時光。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴無數次地回憶曾讀過的書，去過的地方，遇到過的人，保持讓思維的運轉。面對長期的轉化教育，她把自己想像成一個女特務。女特務不像女英雄，永遠慷慨激昂，在那種環境裏，用本色去應對會很快被消耗。女特務懂得斡旋，她聰明、狡猾，在保護自己的同時，也不會忘記自己的使命。</p>\n<p>但黃雪琴又對這套「把自己想像成一個女特務」的方式非常警惕，因為這樣就達到了轉化教育的目的：讓真誠的人變得沉默、逢場作戲、表裏不一。她厭惡這種做法，她喜歡坐在草地上和身邊的人暢談。坦誠、真實，對她來說非常重要。</p>\n<p>曾經在2020年參與聲援黃雪琴的小北，初次見面便覺得她是個特別有原則的人。當時他們分組玩遊戲，規則是，如果每組都選擇同一個數字，便都可以獲得加分，如果其中一組和其它組選的不一樣，則選擇不一樣的組可以加分，其它相同選擇的組要扣分。組與組之間可以交談，以協商或欺騙的方式說服對方，最後哪個組得到最高分，哪個組獲勝。</p>\n<p>一場遊戲中的爾虞我詐開始了。有些組為了勝利而選擇拉攏、欺騙。但黃雪琴堅持認為，大家一定要共贏，建立彼此信任的夥伴關係，不能被遊戲規則操弄。小北說，雪琴當時非常激動，說到最後甚至哭了出來。</p>\n<p>對黃雪琴來說，保持敏感，保持對痛苦和憤怒的感知才能在這個荒謬時代中，做一個更好的記者。</p>\n<p><img

of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士，卻再次因被捕而無法成行。</p>","more":"<p>2021年9月19日，黃雪琴同廣州職業病權益倡導者王建兵突然遭到廣州警方抓捕。警方以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權罪」於王建兵住處拘捕兩人，並疑對其採取強制措施「指定居所監視居住」，主要原因或涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚會。在家屬一再要求下，警方不僅拒絕向家屬出具通知書，亦拒絕告知兩人涉嫌罪名、採取何種強制措施等。另外，警方要求家屬對該事件保持沉默，不可與外界溝通，不得接受媒體採訪。10月26日，是兩人失聯第37天，親友仍未獲知兩人關押情況（依照中國法律，在檢察機關批准逮捕或釋放之前，公安機關可以拘留公民最長37天）。</p>\n<p>2020年10月，颱風要來了。黃雪琴打算拆掉樓下的監控攝像頭，看到手機上的惡劣天氣預警，感到開心。</p>\n<p>距離取保候審已過去半年多，但她的生活沒有恢復平靜。因為參加、記錄香港反修例運動，她被關押了三個月，並且進入了一個國保（負責中國國內安全保衞的警察）定期「訪問」的名單。除了應對警察日常騷擾，處理抓捕帶來的傷害，還要想辦法舒緩給家人造成的壓力和創傷。此外，受取保規定限制，她無法公開在被指定居所監視居住期間的經歷，這對一個堅持自由發聲記者來說，帶來的剝奪感和壓迫感比常人更甚。</p>\n<p>有天黃雪琴下樓遛狗，發現樓梯口的垃圾分類站上多了個攝像頭。她走遍了小區其它20個垃圾分類站，確定只有她家樓下有。很明顯，這攝像頭是為了她而安裝的。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴決定，要趁颱風天把這個攝像頭砸掉。</p>\n<p>「砸掉」的想法鼓舞了她的朋友們，作為用報導拉開中國#metoo運動的開端的記者，黃雪琴一直堅持透過平和理性的方式來爭取社會公義：她做獨立調查報告，書寫記錄社會不公不義，給受害者鏈接資源進行維權，發起聯名訴求，公開演講和組織培訓。朋友們認為黃雪琴的做法一直都很温和，所以當她提出要砸掉攝像頭，紛紛表示支持，甚至幫她想了很多砸掉的方式。</p>\n<p>颱風天來了又走，黃雪琴最後還是選擇了一種更「雪琴」的方式來表達抗議。她在每天出門遛狗的時候去攝像頭下舉牌「非法安裝攝像頭，要求信息公開」；她唱了首《Do you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。</p>\n<p>會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。  </p>\n<p><img

title=\"做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」\"></a>做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」</h2><p>抗爭者，這並非黃雪琴原本為自己選擇的角色。她曾是國有媒體的一員，相信體制內改良，並為此積極書寫，出謀獻策。</p>\n<p>2010年，大學畢業後，黃雪琴成為中國新聞社廣東分社的記者，後又進入《新快報》、《南都週刊》等新鋭媒體做調查記者。</p>\n<p>2000年到2015年前後，中國大陸媒體經歷了輝煌而短暫的輿論監督時期。以《南方週末》、《南方都市報》為核心的南方報業媒體是推動社會改革的傳媒主力之一：2003年《南方都市報》關於「孫志剛事件」的報導參與推動政府廢除了實施多年的「收容遣送制度」；同年該報突破當局的新聞封鎖，報導了非典疫情在廣東省內蔓延的情況，促使當局放開有關疫情的相關信息。2012年，《南都週刊》的《起底王立軍》系列文章，更是對中共高級官員的政治鬥爭進行了深度曝光。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴正是抓着這段黃金時代的尾巴進入媒體行業。那時她所在的城市——廣州，有着「中國最接近公民社會」狀態的美譽。她在每週的「市長接待日」上，記錄市民對市長的直接質問。時任廣州市長萬慶良因為一句「在珠江帝景租房子，每月交租600元」的言論，被媒體批評，一市之長淪為坊間笑談。彼時的黃雪琴認為，做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴開始用手中的筆揭露社會的黑暗面，期待用報導推動社會改變。她寫的關於越南乳豬走私的調查報導，導致該地檢疫局兩名官員下台；關於深圳自閉症兒童的文章，引來相關人士對該民間機構的支持…… 那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。</p>\n<p>那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。</p>\n<p>2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。</p>\n<p>肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。</p>\n<p><img

id=\"意外成為中國-MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\"><a href=\"#意外成為中國-MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\"></a>意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一</h2><p>2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。</p>\n<p>彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。</p>\n<p>了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。</p>\n<p>於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。</p>\n<p><img

id=\"「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\"><a href=\"#「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\"></a>「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」</h2><p>6月9日，為了反對修訂逃犯條例，100多萬香港人走上街頭，用和平遊行的方式表達反對態度。在社會運動的歷史現場，黃雪琴帶着要去「發聲、參與、見證並記錄」的心態，加入了最初的遊行。</p>\n<p>她跟着人群走，一邊在朋友圈發着現場的照片和視頻，卻發現相關內容不斷被屏蔽刪除。香港運動成為敏感度最高的話題。在大陸，一切關於反修例運動的信息都會受到審查，當局開動宣傳機器，稱抗爭者「與境外勢力勾結」，用暴力反對一國兩制，是「港獨」、「暴徒」。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴在現場看到這些官方敘事中的「暴徒」是如何有序地參與遊行，如何有禮貌地給彼此讓路，又如何使用和理非方式表達自己；也看到官方宣傳污名化、妖魔化運動後導致的輿論撕裂，她更明白真實記錄的重要。視頻照片發不出去，她就發文字「七分之一的香港人走上街頭，反對惡法」。朋友們看到了來問她「香港發生了什麼？反對什麼惡法？為什麼反對？」，她都一一耐心解釋。</p>\n<p>後來，微博、微信上關於這場抗爭的痕跡被抹去，她自己的賬號也被禁言，官方媒體只允許「暴徒亂港」一種定論，她感覺這場運動會像30年前北京天安門那場運動一樣被國家機器抹除、改寫，一種使命感和責任感湧上來，她要承擔起一位記者的責任，要記錄下歷史的碎片，要盡力還原現場真實的聲音，抱着這樣一種心情，她實名寫下了那篇《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》，正是這篇文章直接讓她陷入牢獄之災。</p>\n<p>文章發出來的第二天深夜，警察便去到她廣州的家裏找她的家人，要求黃雪琴「閉嘴」。之後，黃雪琴返回大陸家中當晚，就被抓了。</p>\n<p>按照同行Anne的話說，「除了履行作為記者的職責報導香港反送中運動之外，她什麼都沒有做」。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴考慮過後果，深思熟慮後，她認為自己做不到不去記錄，對她來說，那是記者，尤其是在場的記者的失職。正如《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》文章最後所說，「親身經歷了，見證了，就不能假裝無知，不能放棄記錄，不能坐而待斃。黑暗無邊，僅剩的一絲真實和亮光，絕對不能拱手相讓。」</p>\n<p>「一秒鐘的黑暗不會讓人成為瞎子」——在被關押的黑暗的時間中，也是這句話給了黃雪琴力量。</p>\n<p>國家暴力機關對待異見者、行動者一般是先展現「鐵拳」和暴力，然後是漫長的關押，教育，轉化。對被監禁者而言，最初的恐嚇與威脅慢慢失效，後來的敵人，變成了漫長無盡頭的時光。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴無數次地回憶曾讀過的書，去過的地方，遇到過的人，保持讓思維的運轉。面對長期的轉化教育，她把自己想像成一個女特務。女特務不像女英雄，永遠慷慨激昂，在那種環境裏，用本色去應對會很快被消耗。女特務懂得斡旋，她聰明、狡猾，在保護自己的同時，也不會忘記自己的使命。</p>\n<p>但黃雪琴又對這套「把自己想像成一個女特務」的方式非常警惕，因為這樣就達到了轉化教育的目的：讓真誠的人變得沉默、逢場作戲、表裏不一。她厭惡這種做法，她喜歡坐在草地上和身邊的人暢談。坦誠、真實，對她來說非常重要。</p>\n<p>曾經在2020年參與聲援黃雪琴的小北，初次見面便覺得她是個特別有原則的人。當時他們分組玩遊戲，規則是，如果每組都選擇同一個數字，便都可以獲得加分，如果其中一組和其它組選的不一樣，則選擇不一樣的組可以加分，其它相同選擇的組要扣分。組與組之間可以交談，以協商或欺騙的方式說服對方，最後哪個組得到最高分，哪個組獲勝。</p>\n<p>一場遊戲中的爾虞我詐開始了。有些組為了勝利而選擇拉攏、欺騙。但黃雪琴堅持認為，大家一定要共贏，建立彼此信任的夥伴關係，不能被遊戲規則操弄。小北說，雪琴當時非常激動，說到最後甚至哭了出來。</p>\n<p>對黃雪琴來說，保持敏感，保持對痛苦和憤怒的感知才能在這個荒謬時代中，做一個更好的記者。</p>\n<p><img

She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master's study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  \n\nOn September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor's Office.)\n\n---\n\nIn October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. \n\nHer life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.\n\nOne day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. \n\nHuang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. \n\nThis idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.\n\nThe storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.\n\nThe next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)\n\n## Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\n\nBeing a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning. She used to be a member of state-owned media and believed in institutional reforms. She used to actively write and propose suggestions for it.\n\nIn 2010, after graduation, Xueqin became a journalist of the Guangdong department of Chinese News Service (中国新闻社). After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government's news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. \n\nHuang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.\n\nHuang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.\n\nBeing a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.\n\nIn early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident\", the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the \"Innovation Department\". The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.\n\nIn this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.\n\nHuang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.\n\nThis photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased. Photo: provided by the author.\n\n## I can do independent investigation without an institution\n\nIn August 2015, a container storage in the port of Tianjin explored due to inappropriate storage of dangerous chemical materials, which killed 165 people and injured 798 people. Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.\n\nAt that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.\n\nOn the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…\n\nFinally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.\n\nWhen the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.\n\nThis experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.\n\nLater on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.\n\nApart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.\n\n## Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\n\nIn October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.\n\nShe wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”\n\nAt the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.\n\nHuang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.\n\nTherefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.\n\nCaption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author\n\nHuang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.\n\nCharlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.\n\nHuang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.\n\nThe government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.\n\nA foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.\n\nIt was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”\n\nHer optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”\n\n## Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\n\nHer optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master's degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nOf course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.\n\nAt first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees' stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, \"Women's Prison A101\", in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.\n\nLater, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.\n\nIn such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince's beloved one.\n\nThis somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for \"independent spirit, and free thought\", as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.\n\nAll of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of \"aphasia\" from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.\n\nIt was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.\n\n## After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away \n\nOn June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.\n\nShe followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters \"collaborate with foreign forces\" and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.\n\nLater on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong' as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.\n\nLate at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.\n\nAccording to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nHuang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , 'If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.\"\n\n‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.\n\nNational bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.\n\nHuang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent'. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.\n\nHowever, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of 'imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.\n\nXiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.\n\nThis game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.\n\nFor Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.\n\n## How could a journalist keep silent\n\nAfter being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it's not you who are being eaten, please don't worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.\n\nShe kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It's already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.\n\nFor sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. \n\nAlthough she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.\n\n‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA \"Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award\". It just didn't happen to her that she would step on similar paths with those females that she reported on soon.\n\nAt the end of the interview, I asked her what her ideal society looks like. \n\nShe said that it is kind of ‘pandemonium'. Everyone could grow naturally and freely. Some people are evildoers and some are fighters. They should be like a herb garden with all kinds of flowers in full bloom.\n\nI asked, what is your role in it?\n\nShe answered without hesitation, ‘I am the recorder. I will take my pen and my lens to record how each flower grows, blooms, and withers’. Then she added to, ‘Of course I myself will bloom too’.\n\nAll interviewees are pseudonyms except for Huang Xueqin.\n\n[Chinese version](https://ngocn2.org/article/2021-10-26-huang-xue-qin/)\n\n翻译：小雷、AI、44、LK\n校对：Lee、Hua\n\n","source":"_posts/huang-xueqin-journalist.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: \"Huang Xueqin: “How Could a Journalist Keep Silent”\"\ndate: 2021-11-17T05:18:38.562Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/kRFWG9D.png\ncategories:\n  - 媒体报道\ntags:\n  - English\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EJtXf4j.png)\n\n## Background\n\nHuang Xueqin is a Chinese independent investigation journalist and a feminist activist. She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master's study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  \n\nOn September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor's Office.)\n\n---\n\nIn October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. \n\nHer life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.\n\nOne day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. \n\nHuang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. \n\nThis idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.\n\nThe storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.\n\nThe next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)\n\n## Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\n\nBeing a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning. She used to be a member of state-owned media and believed in institutional reforms. She used to actively write and propose suggestions for it.\n\nIn 2010, after graduation, Xueqin became a journalist of the Guangdong department of Chinese News Service (中国新闻社). After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government's news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. \n\nHuang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.\n\nHuang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.\n\nBeing a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.\n\nIn early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident\", the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the \"Innovation Department\". The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.\n\nIn this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.\n\nHuang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.\n\nThis photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased. Photo: provided by the author.\n\n## I can do independent investigation without an institution\n\nIn August 2015, a container storage in the port of Tianjin explored due to inappropriate storage of dangerous chemical materials, which killed 165 people and injured 798 people. Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.\n\nAt that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.\n\nOn the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…\n\nFinally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.\n\nWhen the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.\n\nThis experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.\n\nLater on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.\n\nApart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.\n\n## Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\n\nIn October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.\n\nShe wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”\n\nAt the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.\n\nHuang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.\n\nTherefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.\n\nCaption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author\n\nHuang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.\n\nCharlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.\n\nHuang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.\n\nThe government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.\n\nA foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.\n\nIt was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”\n\nHer optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”\n\n## Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\n\nHer optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master's degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nOf course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.\n\nAt first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees' stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, \"Women's Prison A101\", in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.\n\nLater, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.\n\nIn such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince's beloved one.\n\nThis somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for \"independent spirit, and free thought\", as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.\n\nAll of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of \"aphasia\" from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.\n\nIt was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.\n\n## After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away \n\nOn June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.\n\nShe followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters \"collaborate with foreign forces\" and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.\n\nLater on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong' as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.\n\nLate at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.\n\nAccording to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nHuang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , 'If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.\"\n\n‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.\n\nNational bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.\n\nHuang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent'. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.\n\nHowever, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of 'imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.\n\nXiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.\n\nThis game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.\n\nFor Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.\n\n## How could a journalist keep silent\n\nAfter being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it's not you who are being eaten, please don't worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.\n\nShe kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It's already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.\n\nFor sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. \n\nAlthough she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.\n\n‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA \"Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award\". It just didn't happen to her that she would step on similar paths with those females that she reported on soon.\n\nAt the end of the interview, I asked her what her ideal society looks like. \n\nShe said that it is kind of ‘pandemonium'. Everyone could grow naturally and freely. Some people are evildoers and some are fighters.

She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master’s study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  </p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor’s Office.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. </p>\n<p>Her life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.</p>\n<p>One day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. </p>\n<p>This idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.</p>\n<p>The storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.</p>\n<p>The next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)</p>\n<h2 id=\"Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\"><a href=\"#Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\"></a>Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing</h2><p>Being a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning. She used to be a member of state-owned media and believed in institutional reforms. She used to actively write and propose suggestions for it.</p>\n<p>In 2010, after graduation, Xueqin became a journalist of the Guangdong department of Chinese News Service (中国新闻社). After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.</p>\n<p>Between 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government’s news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.</p>\n<p>Being a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.</p>\n<p>In early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident”, the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the “Innovation Department”. The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.</p>\n<p>In this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.</p>\n<p>This photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased.

Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.</p>\n<p>At that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.</p>\n<p>On the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…</p>\n<p>Finally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.</p>\n<p>When the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.</p>\n<p>This experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.</p>\n<p>Later on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>Apart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\"><a href=\"#Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\"></a>Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China</h2><p>In October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.</p>\n<p>She wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.</p>\n<p>Therefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Caption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Charlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.</p>\n<p>The government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.</p>\n<p>A foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>It was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”</p>\n<p>Her optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”</p>\n<h2 id=\"Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\"><a href=\"#Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\"></a>Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.</h2><p>Her optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master’s degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Of course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.</p>\n<p>At first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees’ stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, “Women’s Prison A101”, in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.</p>\n<p>Later, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.</p>\n<p>In such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince’s beloved one.</p>\n<p>This somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for “independent spirit, and free thought”, as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.</p>\n<p>All of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of “aphasia” from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.</p>\n<p>It was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\"><a href=\"#After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away\"></a>After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away</h2><p>On June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.</p>\n<p>She followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters “collaborate with foreign forces” and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.</p>\n<p>Later on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong’ as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.</p>\n<p>Late at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.</p>\n<p>According to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , ‘If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.”</p>\n<p>‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.</p>\n<p>National bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent’. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.</p>\n<p>However, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of ‘imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.</p>\n<p>Xiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.</p>\n<p>This game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.</p>\n<p>For Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\"><a href=\"#How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How could a journalist keep silent\"></a>How could a journalist keep silent</h2><p>After being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it’s not you who are being eaten, please don’t worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.</p>\n<p>She kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It’s already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.</p>\n<p>For sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. </p>\n<p>Although she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.</p>\n<p>‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA “Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award”. It just didn’t happen to her that she would step on similar paths with those females that she reported on soon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the interview, I asked her what her ideal society looks like. </p>\n<p>She said that it is kind of ‘pandemonium’. Everyone could grow naturally and freely. Some people are evildoers and some are fighters.

She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master’s study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  </p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor’s Office.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. </p>\n<p>Her life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.</p>\n<p>One day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. </p>\n<p>This idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.</p>\n<p>The storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.</p>\n<p>The next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)</p>\n<h2 id=\"Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\"><a href=\"#Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\"></a>Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing</h2><p>Being a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning. She used to be a member of state-owned media and believed in institutional reforms. She used to actively write and propose suggestions for it.</p>\n<p>In 2010, after graduation, Xueqin became a journalist of the Guangdong department of Chinese News Service (中国新闻社). After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.</p>\n<p>Between 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government’s news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.</p>\n<p>Being a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.</p>\n<p>In early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident”, the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the “Innovation Department”. The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.</p>\n<p>In this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.</p>\n<p>This photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased.

Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.</p>\n<p>At that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.</p>\n<p>On the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…</p>\n<p>Finally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.</p>\n<p>When the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.</p>\n<p>This experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.</p>\n<p>Later on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>Apart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\"><a href=\"#Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\"></a>Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China</h2><p>In October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.</p>\n<p>She wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.</p>\n<p>Therefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Caption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Charlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.</p>\n<p>The government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.</p>\n<p>A foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>It was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”</p>\n<p>Her optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”</p>\n<h2 id=\"Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\"><a href=\"#Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\"></a>Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.</h2><p>Her optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master’s degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Of course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.</p>\n<p>At first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees’ stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, “Women’s Prison A101”, in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.</p>\n<p>Later, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.</p>\n<p>In such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince’s beloved one.</p>\n<p>This somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for “independent spirit, and free thought”, as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.</p>\n<p>All of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of “aphasia” from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.</p>\n<p>It was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\"><a href=\"#After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away\"></a>After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away</h2><p>On June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.</p>\n<p>She followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters “collaborate with foreign forces” and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.</p>\n<p>Later on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong’ as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.</p>\n<p>Late at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.</p>\n<p>According to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , ‘If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.”</p>\n<p>‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.</p>\n<p>National bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent’. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.</p>\n<p>However, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of ‘imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.</p>\n<p>Xiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.</p>\n<p>This game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.</p>\n<p>For Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\"><a href=\"#How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How could a journalist keep silent\"></a>How could a journalist keep silent</h2><p>After being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it’s not you who are being eaten, please don’t worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.</p>\n<p>She kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It’s already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.</p>\n<p>For sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. </p>\n<p>Although she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.</p>\n<p>‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA “Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award”.

It will provide a comprehensive account of the secret arrest of \"Xuebing\", as well as the ongoing progress of the case. We hope that friends from civil society community, media, and international community could continue to stay tuned, and support Huang and Wang. We urge the Guangzhou police to release them unconditionally. This document will be continuously updated (by 2021.11.19).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## 发生了什么？What Happened?\n\n2021年9月19日下午，女权记者黄雪琴、职业病权益倡导者王建兵（昵称“煎饼”）于王建兵住处失联。后经确认，两人于当天下午3点左右被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动国家政权罪”抓捕，并疑对双方采取了“指定居所监视居住”（RSDL)，但警方并未给家属寄送法律规定的通知书。黄雪琴原计划于9月20日经深圳前往香港机场，飞赴英国留学，而王建兵则原计划于当天给其送行。\n\nFeminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease advocate Wang Jianbing (nicknamed \"pancake\", pronounced as \"Jianbing\" in Mandarin Chinese) were secretly taken away, last seen at Wang Jianbing's apartment, since the afternoon of September 19, 2021. It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。\n\nLatest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin's family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.\n\n此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. \n- 2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.\" The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.\n- 2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent.

This document will be continuously updated (by 2021.11.19).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## 发生了什么？What Happened?\n\n2021年9月19日下午，女权记者黄雪琴、职业病权益倡导者王建兵（昵称“煎饼”）于王建兵住处失联。后经确认，两人于当天下午3点左右被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动国家政权罪”抓捕，并疑对双方采取了“指定居所监视居住”（RSDL)，但警方并未给家属寄送法律规定的通知书。黄雪琴原计划于9月20日经深圳前往香港机场，飞赴英国留学，而王建兵则原计划于当天给其送行。\n\nFeminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease advocate Wang Jianbing (nicknamed \"pancake\", pronounced as \"Jianbing\" in Mandarin Chinese) were secretly taken away, last seen at Wang Jianbing's apartment, since the afternoon of September 19, 2021. It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。\n\nLatest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin's family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.\n\n此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. \n- 2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour.

The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent. The IFJ stands in solidarity with Huang, who has faced continual harassment by Chinese authorities for drawing attention to important issues in the public interest.””\n\n4. **Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中国人权捍卫者）**: China: immediately release #MeToo activist and fellow civil society advocate, 2021.09.21, https://www.nchrd.org/2021/09/china-immediately-release-metoo-activist-and-fellow-civil-society-advocate/\n\n> “A journalist and an activist have gone missing for two days from the southern provincial capital of Guangzhou.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.</p>\n<p>黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关<a href=\"https://matters.news/@sophia/%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84-%E5%8F%8D%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD-%E5%A4%A7%E6%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA\">文章</a>，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.</p>\n<h2 id=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\"><a href=\"#抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\"></a>抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?</h2><p>自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：<strong>王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。</strong>警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。</p>\n<p>Since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin’s family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.</p>\n<p>此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，<strong>但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。</strong>雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。</p>\n<p>After being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline-of-Arrest\"><a href=\"#“0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline-of-Arrest\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\"></a>“0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest</h2><p>以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：</p>\n<p>The followings are the main timeline of 0919 “Xuebing” case.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police.

They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: “We can’t confirm the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.” </li>\n<li>2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang’d family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.” The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.</li>\n<li>2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\"><a href=\"#国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\"></a>国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity</h2><ol>\n<li><strong>Amnesty International (国际特赦)</strong>: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/\">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/</a> </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support.

She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex.

Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin’s family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.</p>\n<p>此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，<strong>但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。</strong>雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。</p>\n<p>After being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center.

Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated by the notice.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. </li>\n<li>Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. </li>\n<li>2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: “We can’t confirm the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.” </li>\n<li>2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang’d family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.” The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.</li>\n<li>2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\"><a href=\"#国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\"></a>国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity</h2><ol>\n<li><strong>Amnesty International (国际特赦)</strong>: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/\">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/</a> </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others.

它允许政府可以不经审讯把人关在“黑监狱”里。人权机构“保护卫士”（Safeguard Defenders）估计，自习近平2013年就任国家主席以来，已有约45000至55000人被指定居所监视居住，其中仅2020年就多达15000人。</p>\n<p><img

Law说，他有一种很朴实简单的“社会正义感”。方然经常在微信发表有关工人权利、性骚扰以及对城市外来人员的驱赶等社会问题的帖子。他来往于中国南方的工厂区，投身于工人的生活，并曾在工人尝试罢工或寻求工伤赔偿时给予支持。</p>\n<p>“他是一个真正寻求真理的人”，22岁的Law说 ，“虽然他在做劳工研究，但他不会死守任何意识形态或教条，像马克思主义或是别的什么…他是真的很热衷于帮助别人”。</p>\n<p>Law说，方然已多次因为对劳工议题的关注而被叫去“喝茶”——这是一种在中国受到安全部门威胁的委婉说法。但他并没有被吓倒。二月，他做了一次关于1970年代南韩专制统治下劳工运动发展的线上分享。</p>\n<p>八月，他回到中国大陆做田野调查。国安部门在八月下旬再次叫他“喝茶”；从那之后，就再没有听过方然的消息。尽管一位要求匿名以保护自己的亲友表示，方然正在接受“教育”，应该能“很快”出去。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M84CQA7.png\"></p>\n<center>王建兵致力于帮助建筑业工人，他们因尘肺病或职业性肺病处于垂死状况中。他们在中国是最被忽视的人群中的一部分。（图片来自雪饼的朋友）</center>\n\n<p>在方然被消失后没多久，王建兵和黄雪琴在9月19日去机场的路上失踪。黄雪琴是一名独立记者和#MeToo行动者，她获得了著名的志奋领奖学金，将前往英国萨克塞斯大学（​​University of Sussex）进行“性别、暴力与冲突”的硕士项目学习。</p>\n<p>38岁的王建兵，是一名劳工权利行动者，他经常邀请志同道合的年轻人在家里聚会。那天王准备给黄送机，但之后两人的电话就无法接通。据朋友的消息，在失联一天内，警察去到王在甘肃的老家，警告家人保持沉默。在广州，警察搜查了王建兵和黄雪琴两人的住处，并登录了王的脸书（facebook）账号。</p>\n<p>当局阻挠了家人询问王的被捕信息的请求，并拒绝了他们聘请的律师。警察也传唤和审讯40多位与两人相关的朋友，其中一些甚至被连续讯问24小时。朋友们的家也被搜查，警察还拷贝了他们电子设备上的文件。</p>\n<p>很多被问讯的人是因为被安装在王家附近的摄像头拍下了人脸照片。朋友们说，警方逼迫他们签署虚假供述，指控王建兵和黄雪琴日常聚会中批评政府。</p>\n<p>王的朋友Rio说，这种说法很荒谬。他说，他和其他年轻人这所以每周会在建兵家聚会，是因为大家都有共通的“政治性抑郁”。大多数时候，他们品茶、吃水果和分享个人故事，有时侯玩玩儿麻将或者去爬山。“仅是在家里的聚会就是想要颠覆国家政权的想法不可思议”，Rio说，“我们都很现实，我们从未自信的认为我们可以整整改变这个社会的结构压迫。在这个时代，在这个每个人都很压抑的时刻，我们只想能保有多一点点尊严地活着…能和朋友们在一起。”</p>\n<p>王建兵致力于帮助因为尘肺病或职业性肺病处于垂死状态的建筑工人，他们在中国是最被忽视的人群中的一部分。他们中的大多数人贫穷和已经死去。地方政府则经常骚扰任何为他们发声的人。王没有任何资金和政治影响力，但他多年帮助他们，经常去探访他们，让他们在濒死的日子里不那么寂寞。Rio说，“他注重倾听他人，他尊重每一个人，相信每个人都有尊严”。</p>\n<p>11月5日，在王建兵失踪一个多月后，他的家人收到了警方的通知，告知王于10月27日被以“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被正式逮捕。黄的家人也在10月底收到了类似的通知书。</p>\n<p>在被问到王、黄的消息时，广州市公安局说个案不便置评，官方说可以联系拘留所询问。本报多次拨打广州市第一看守所的电话都无人接听。据报道，黄王两人被关押在此处 。</p>\n<p>33岁的黄雪琴曾经被拘留过。2019年，警方阻止她前往香港攻读法学硕士学位。因为在网上发表关于香港民主抗议的文章，她被指定居所监视居住3个月。在被释放后的一年里，她仍然处于监控之下，一个特别的摄像头被安装在她住处的楼梯间。她在摄像头前举牌抗议非法监控；她还对着镜头唱“你听到人民在歌唱吗？（Do you hear the people sing）”。她向国宝展示信息公开申请，要求公开花在该监控上的公共财政支出。有一天，当黄准确去镜头前朗读抗议诗歌时，她发现摄像头已经不在了。她在网上把这次经历写成了帖子，并加上“#抗争有用”的话题标签。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QSJcqWY.png\"></p>\n<center>黄雪琴，调查过中国#MeToo (米兔)案件，在2019年也被捕过，当时中国公安阻止她前往香港攻读法学硕士。（图片来自雪饼的朋友）</center>\n\n<p>黄还撰文讲述其他女权和劳工权利运动者面对的压制，包括一篇获奖的文章，该文章记录了李翘楚的故事：李翘楚，30岁，曾因“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被指定居所监视居住四个月；她曾在2020年6月被释放，但因为她在网上声援她的伴侣–公民运动倡导者许志永–在拘留中遭遇的恶劣对待，在今年2月又再次被捕。</p>\n<p>李在她讲述其被关押期间经历的文章中说道：“那种屈辱感在之后很长一段时间里仍然困扰着我”。警卫强迫她朗读数十篇批判许志永的文章，“那感觉就像我想咬舌自尽但不成功，之后还要用残存的舌头去唱赞歌”。</p>\n<p>黄雪琴的护照今年被警方归还。她的朋友说，意味着警方那应该将不会再对她出境进行干涉。但，她们错了。</p>\n<p>“我感到非常无助”，Rio说，“他们需要帮助，但我能做的只能盲目无助地担心…,你只能等着看看他们什么时候会被定罪、会被判入狱多久。你面对着这个政府所做的一些，它的任何秘密行动，你都无能为力。”</p>\n<p>Rio说，过去唯一能抵御这种恐惧感的，是跟信任的朋友们聚在一起，一起欢笑，感受到自己被理解，自己也并不孤单…但现在，即便是这样也已经是危险的了。</p>\n<p>作者：Alice

before the 2021 International Human Rights Day, the community of UK's Chevening Scholarship Alumni released a joint letter to express solidarity with detained Chinese feminist journalist Huang Xueqin and her friend, an occupational disease activist, Wang Jianbing\n\n\n\n**連署亮點**：全球超過30個國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共112位Chevening志奮領獎學金學人簽署聲援公開信，要求英國外交部與其旗下志奮領獎學金，公開表態支持失聯的中國女權記者黃雪琴與職業病權益倡導者王建兵，並開啟針對本案不限層級的對中人權對話。\n\nA total of 112 Chevening scholars from across 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021, have signed a letter of solidarity. The letter requests the UK's Foreign Ministry and Chevening to publicly support detained Chinese feminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease activist Wang Jianbing, and to have an open dialogue about human rights with the Chinese government.\n\n\n\n\n\n中國女權記者與#metoo行動家黃雪琴為英國Chevening（志奮領）2021/22獎學金的中國得主，原計劃於9月20日經深圳前往香港機場，飛赴英國University of Sussex留學，其友職業病權益倡導者王建兵（暱稱「煎餅」）則原計劃於當天爲其送行。然而，兩人於今年9月19日下午3點，啟程赴英前夕，在王建兵廣州家中失聯超過兩個月。\n\nChinese independent investigative journalist and #Metoo activist Huang Xueqin is the Chinese winner of the 2021/22 Chevening scholarship. She planned to arrive at Hong Kong airport from Guangzhou first and then fly from there to the University of Sussex in the UK to start her postgraduate program on September 20. Her friend, an occupational disease activist, Wang Jianbing (known as \"pancake,\" or jianbing in Chinese), planned to accompany her off at the airport. Yet at 3 pm, September 19, on the eve of Huang's departure, they were both detained at Wang Jianbing's home in Guangzhou. It has been over two months since that happened.\n\n\n\n直至11月5日，王建兵家屬於收到廣州市公安局發出的編號「穗公捕通字[2021]X2逮捕通知書」後，才正式確認王建兵已於10月27日被廣州市公安局以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權」的名義被執行逮捕，現拘留於廣州市第一看守所。過程中，王建兵的律師多次申請會見和取保候審，皆被中國警方拒絕，家屬與律師至今無法會見受關押的王建兵與黃雪琴（簡稱：「雪餅」）。\n\nOn November 5, Wang Jianbing's family received from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau a \"notice of arrest\" numbered \"[2021] x 2.\" It officially confirmed that Wang Jianbing was arrested under the charge of \" Inciting subversion of state power.” He is currently detained at Guangzhou’s Number 1 Detention Center. During this period, Wang Jianbing's lawyer tried several times to meet him and apply for his release on bail. Yet these requests were rejected by the Chinese authorities. Until now, family members of the two detainees (known together as “Xuebing\"(Snow Pellets), a Chinese cookie) have not been able to meet them.\n\n\n\n該政治打壓案件至今已陸續獲得Amnesty International (國際特赦)、Reporters Without Borders (無國界記者)、International Federation of Journalists、Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中國人權捍衛者）及The Coalition For Women in Journalism（女性新聞工作者聯盟）等國際組織的關注與聲援。（詳見：https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/）\n\n由於黃雪琴的Chevening（志奮領）獎學金得主身份，及其在女權與言論自由上的持續貢獻，此案件已引起全球Chevening（志奮領）校友社群得關注。\n\nThis case of political repression has received the attention and support of many international groups, such as Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, International Federation of Journalists, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and The Coalition For Women in Journalism. (For details, please check https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/.) As a winner of the UK Chevening scholarship and a restless fighter for the freedom of expression and women's rights, Huang Xueqin’s experience has evoked serious concerns within the Chevening alumni community.\n\n\n\n志奮領校友發起全球連署，短短一週內就搜集到超過30國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共計112位志奮領校友在第一階段加入連署，聲援「0919雪餅案」。簽署者最大宗依序來自哥倫比亞、巴西、印度、台灣、墨西哥及南非，展現志奮領獎學金社群對本案的強烈關注，以及對英國外交部與志奮領獎學金在此案件上有所表態與作為的正面期待。\n\n\nThe community soon released an open letter. Within one week since the start of the petition, they collected signatures from 112 Chevening alumni across over 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021. Most signatories came from Colombia, Brazil, India, Taiwan, Mexico, and South Africa. These signatures demonstrate that the Chevening alumni are paying close attention to the suffering of the two detainees. There is an expectation within the community that the UK Foreign Ministry and Chevening will take a stance and act positively on this case.\n\n\n\n\n「英國政府已於11月20日發表聲明，呼籲中國當局應提供可驗證的證據，對外說明女網球星彭帥的安危和下落。英國政府當然也必須針對中國記者黃雪琴的失蹤表達關切，因為她已經獲得英國政府提供的志奮領獎學金，卻在九月要離開廣州、前往Sussex大學進修的前一天人間蒸發」畢業於Loughborough University的志奮領獎學金校友，來自台灣的呂秉原說。\n\n“The UK government has released a statement on 20 November 2021 to urge the Chinese authorities to provide verifiable evidence of tennis star Peng Shuai’s safety and whereabouts. It, of course, also needs to express its concerns over the disappearance of Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin, who has been awarded the UK government’s Chevening scholarship but went missing one day before she was scheduled to leave Guangzhou in September to study at the University of Sussex.\" said Chevening Scholarship alumnus and a graduate of Loughborough University, Edward Pingyuan from Taiwan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n「黃雪琴是中國一個優秀的記者和女性主義行動者，認識她的朋友都會覺得她nice, 謙和，非常的有能量，是一個完全優秀的志奮領學人。如今在她即將赴英國的路程中被拘留，英國政府和志奮領至今未曾對此發出過任何的聲明和公開的表達，讓我們感到十分的痛心和難過，她如此優秀如此deserve這個獎學金和海外自由學習的氛圍，真希望志奮領能幫助她獲得更好的對待和生活」一位不願透露姓名與獎學金得獎年份的中國志奮領獎學金得主說。\n\n\"Huang Xueqin is a brilliant journalist and women's rights activist. Friends who know her well describe her as nice, modest, and extremely competent. She is an outstanding Chevening scholar. She was detained when she was about to leave for the UK. The UK government and Chevening have not spoken out publicly about this case, which makes us extremely sad and disappointed. She is remarkable and deserves this scholarship. She should be able to study abroad freely. We hope that Chevening can help her obtain better treatment and a better life,\" said an anonymous Chevening alumnus from China.\n\n\n\n該全球連署除了要求英國外交部旗下的志奮領獎學金發布全球校友信件，比照該獎學金對於其他人權事件的關注，積極呼籲全球志奮領獎學金社群以關注「0919雪餅案」外；更訴求英國外交部及志奮領獎學金針對「0919雪餅案」，展開不限層級的對中人權對話，以保障黃雪琴與王建兵的權利。該全球連署文末，則近一步要求中國當局立即釋放黃雪琴與王建兵。\n\nThe open letter requests the Chevening Scholarship, which is affiliated to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to publish a letter to the global alumni community, asking them to show concerns over the \"0919 Xuebing case,\" as well as to pay more attention to human rights issues in general. In addition, it demands the FCDO and the Chevening leadership to initiate an open dialogue with the Chinese government on this case and to uphold the rights the two detainees deserve. The last part of the letter asks the Chinese authorities to immediately release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\n\n\n此連署已於2021年12月8日公開在本案件官方網站、twitter以及其臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」。同時，已於此前透過英國外館寄發至英國外交部與志奮領獎學金秘書處，目前尚無收到任何回應。\n\nThis letter was published on December 8 (GMT+8) on the official website for the \"0919 Xuebing case,\" as well as on Twitter and the Facebook page \"Free Xueqin & Jianbing.\" Meanwhile, the letter has been sent to the FCDO and the Chevening Secretariat.

Until now, family members of the two detainees (known together as “Xuebing\"(Snow Pellets), a Chinese cookie) have not been able to meet them.\n\n\n\n該政治打壓案件至今已陸續獲得Amnesty International (國際特赦)、Reporters Without Borders (無國界記者)、International Federation of Journalists、Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中國人權捍衛者）及The Coalition For Women in Journalism（女性新聞工作者聯盟）等國際組織的關注與聲援。（詳見：https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/）\n\n由於黃雪琴的Chevening（志奮領）獎學金得主身份，及其在女權與言論自由上的持續貢獻，此案件已引起全球Chevening（志奮領）校友社群得關注。\n\nThis case of political repression has received the attention and support of many international groups, such as Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, International Federation of Journalists, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and The Coalition For Women in Journalism. (For details, please check https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/.) As a winner of the UK Chevening scholarship and a restless fighter for the freedom of expression and women's rights, Huang Xueqin’s experience has evoked serious concerns within the Chevening alumni community.\n\n\n\n志奮領校友發起全球連署，短短一週內就搜集到超過30國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共計112位志奮領校友在第一階段加入連署，聲援「0919雪餅案」。簽署者最大宗依序來自哥倫比亞、巴西、印度、台灣、墨西哥及南非，展現志奮領獎學金社群對本案的強烈關注，以及對英國外交部與志奮領獎學金在此案件上有所表態與作為的正面期待。\n\n\nThe community soon released an open letter. Within one week since the start of the petition, they collected signatures from 112 Chevening alumni across over 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021. Most signatories came from Colombia, Brazil, India, Taiwan, Mexico, and South Africa. These signatures demonstrate that the Chevening alumni are paying close attention to the suffering of the two detainees. There is an expectation within the community that the UK Foreign Ministry and Chevening will take a stance and act positively on this case.\n\n\n\n\n「英國政府已於11月20日發表聲明，呼籲中國當局應提供可驗證的證據，對外說明女網球星彭帥的安危和下落。英國政府當然也必須針對中國記者黃雪琴的失蹤表達關切，因為她已經獲得英國政府提供的志奮領獎學金，卻在九月要離開廣州、前往Sussex大學進修的前一天人間蒸發」畢業於Loughborough University的志奮領獎學金校友，來自台灣的呂秉原說。\n\n“The UK government has released a statement on 20 November 2021 to urge the Chinese authorities to provide verifiable evidence of tennis star Peng Shuai’s safety and whereabouts. It, of course, also needs to express its concerns over the disappearance of Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin, who has been awarded the UK government’s Chevening scholarship but went missing one day before she was scheduled to leave Guangzhou in September to study at the University of Sussex.\" said Chevening Scholarship alumnus and a graduate of Loughborough University, Edward Pingyuan from Taiwan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n「黃雪琴是中國一個優秀的記者和女性主義行動者，認識她的朋友都會覺得她nice, 謙和，非常的有能量，是一個完全優秀的志奮領學人。如今在她即將赴英國的路程中被拘留，英國政府和志奮領至今未曾對此發出過任何的聲明和公開的表達，讓我們感到十分的痛心和難過，她如此優秀如此deserve這個獎學金和海外自由學習的氛圍，真希望志奮領能幫助她獲得更好的對待和生活」一位不願透露姓名與獎學金得獎年份的中國志奮領獎學金得主說。\n\n\"Huang Xueqin is a brilliant journalist and women's rights activist. Friends who know her well describe her as nice, modest, and extremely competent. She is an outstanding Chevening scholar. She was detained when she was about to leave for the UK. The UK government and Chevening have not spoken out publicly about this case, which makes us extremely sad and disappointed. She is remarkable and deserves this scholarship. She should be able to study abroad freely. We hope that Chevening can help her obtain better treatment and a better life,\" said an anonymous Chevening alumnus from China.\n\n\n\n該全球連署除了要求英國外交部旗下的志奮領獎學金發布全球校友信件，比照該獎學金對於其他人權事件的關注，積極呼籲全球志奮領獎學金社群以關注「0919雪餅案」外；更訴求英國外交部及志奮領獎學金針對「0919雪餅案」，展開不限層級的對中人權對話，以保障黃雪琴與王建兵的權利。該全球連署文末，則近一步要求中國當局立即釋放黃雪琴與王建兵。\n\nThe open letter requests the Chevening Scholarship, which is affiliated to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to publish a letter to the global alumni community, asking them to show concerns over the \"0919 Xuebing case,\" as well as to pay more attention to human rights issues in general. In addition, it demands the FCDO and the Chevening leadership to initiate an open dialogue with the Chinese government on this case and to uphold the rights the two detainees deserve. The last part of the letter asks the Chinese authorities to immediately release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\n\n\n此連署已於2021年12月8日公開在本案件官方網站、twitter以及其臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」。同時，已於此前透過英國外館寄發至英國外交部與志奮領獎學金秘書處，目前尚無收到任何回應。\n\nThis letter was published on December 8 (GMT+8) on the official website for the \"0919 Xuebing case,\" as well as on Twitter and the Facebook page \"Free Xueqin & Jianbing.\" Meanwhile, the letter has been sent to the FCDO and the Chevening Secretariat.

before the 2021 International Human Rights Day, the community of UK’s Chevening Scholarship Alumni released a joint letter to express solidarity with detained Chinese feminist journalist Huang Xueqin and her friend, an occupational disease activist, Wang Jianbing</p>\n<p><strong>連署亮點</strong>：全球超過30個國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共112位Chevening志奮領獎學金學人簽署聲援公開信，要求英國外交部與其旗下志奮領獎學金，公開表態支持失聯的中國女權記者黃雪琴與職業病權益倡導者王建兵，並開啟針對本案不限層級的對中人權對話。</p>\n<p>A total of 112 Chevening scholars from across 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021, have signed a letter of solidarity. The letter requests the UK’s Foreign Ministry and Chevening to publicly support detained Chinese feminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease activist Wang Jianbing, and to have an open dialogue about human rights with the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>中國女權記者與#metoo行動家黃雪琴為英國Chevening（志奮領）2021/22獎學金的中國得主，原計劃於9月20日經深圳前往香港機場，飛赴英國University of Sussex留學，其友職業病權益倡導者王建兵（暱稱「煎餅」）則原計劃於當天爲其送行。然而，兩人於今年9月19日下午3點，啟程赴英前夕，在王建兵廣州家中失聯超過兩個月。</p>\n<p>Chinese independent investigative journalist and #Metoo activist Huang Xueqin is the Chinese winner of the 2021/22 Chevening scholarship. She planned to arrive at Hong Kong airport from Guangzhou first and then fly from there to the University of Sussex in the UK to start her postgraduate program on September 20. Her friend, an occupational disease activist, Wang Jianbing (known as “pancake,” or jianbing in Chinese), planned to accompany her off at the airport. Yet at 3 pm, September 19, on the eve of Huang’s departure, they were both detained at Wang Jianbing’s home in Guangzhou. It has been over two months since that happened.</p>\n<p>直至11月5日，王建兵家屬於收到廣州市公安局發出的編號「穗公捕通字[2021]X2逮捕通知書」後，才正式確認王建兵已於10月27日被廣州市公安局以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權」的名義被執行逮捕，現拘留於廣州市第一看守所。過程中，王建兵的律師多次申請會見和取保候審，皆被中國警方拒絕，家屬與律師至今無法會見受關押的王建兵與黃雪琴（簡稱：「雪餅」）。</p>\n<p>On November 5, Wang Jianbing’s family received from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau a “notice of arrest” numbered “[2021] x 2.” It officially confirmed that Wang Jianbing was arrested under the charge of “ Inciting subversion of state power.” He is currently detained at Guangzhou’s Number 1 Detention Center. During this period, Wang Jianbing’s lawyer tried several times to meet him and apply for his release on bail. Yet these requests were rejected by the Chinese authorities. Until now, family members of the two detainees (known together as “Xuebing”(Snow Pellets), a Chinese cookie) have not been able to meet them.</p>\n<p>該政治打壓案件至今已陸續獲得Amnesty International (國際特赦)、Reporters Without Borders (無國界記者)、International Federation of Journalists、Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中國人權捍衛者）及The Coalition For Women in Journalism（女性新聞工作者聯盟）等國際組織的關注與聲援。（詳見：<a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/%EF%BC%89\">https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/）</a></p>\n<p>由於黃雪琴的Chevening（志奮領）獎學金得主身份，及其在女權與言論自由上的持續貢獻，此案件已引起全球Chevening（志奮領）校友社群得關注。</p>\n<p>This case of political repression has received the attention and support of many international groups, such as Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, International Federation of Journalists, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and The Coalition For Women in Journalism. (For details, please check <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/\">https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/</a>.) As a winner of the UK Chevening scholarship and a restless fighter for the freedom of expression and women’s rights, Huang Xueqin’s experience has evoked serious concerns within the Chevening alumni community.</p>\n<p>志奮領校友發起全球連署，短短一週內就搜集到超過30國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共計112位志奮領校友在第一階段加入連署，聲援「0919雪餅案」。簽署者最大宗依序來自哥倫比亞、巴西、印度、台灣、墨西哥及南非，展現志奮領獎學金社群對本案的強烈關注，以及對英國外交部與志奮領獎學金在此案件上有所表態與作為的正面期待。</p>\n<p>The community soon released an open letter. Within one week since the start of the petition, they collected signatures from 112 Chevening alumni across over 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021. Most signatories came from Colombia, Brazil, India, Taiwan, Mexico, and South Africa. These signatures demonstrate that the Chevening alumni are paying close attention to the suffering of the two detainees. There is an expectation within the community that the UK Foreign Ministry and Chevening will take a stance and act positively on this case.</p>\n<p>「英國政府已於11月20日發表聲明，呼籲中國當局應提供可驗證的證據，對外說明女網球星彭帥的安危和下落。英國政府當然也必須針對中國記者黃雪琴的失蹤表達關切，因為她已經獲得英國政府提供的志奮領獎學金，卻在九月要離開廣州、前往Sussex大學進修的前一天人間蒸發」畢業於Loughborough University的志奮領獎學金校友，來自台灣的呂秉原說。</p>\n<p>“The UK government has released a statement on 20 November 2021 to urge the Chinese authorities to provide verifiable evidence of tennis star Peng Shuai’s safety and whereabouts. It, of course, also needs to express its concerns over the disappearance of Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin, who has been awarded the UK government’s Chevening scholarship but went missing one day before she was scheduled to leave Guangzhou in September to study at the University of Sussex.” said Chevening Scholarship alumnus and a graduate of Loughborough University, Edward Pingyuan from Taiwan. </p>\n<p>「黃雪琴是中國一個優秀的記者和女性主義行動者，認識她的朋友都會覺得她nice, 謙和，非常的有能量，是一個完全優秀的志奮領學人。如今在她即將赴英國的路程中被拘留，英國政府和志奮領至今未曾對此發出過任何的聲明和公開的表達，讓我們感到十分的痛心和難過，她如此優秀如此deserve這個獎學金和海外自由學習的氛圍，真希望志奮領能幫助她獲得更好的對待和生活」一位不願透露姓名與獎學金得獎年份的中國志奮領獎學金得主說。</p>\n<p>“Huang Xueqin is a brilliant journalist and women’s rights activist. Friends who know her well describe her as nice, modest, and extremely competent. She is an outstanding Chevening scholar. She was detained when she was about to leave for the UK. The UK government and Chevening have not spoken out publicly about this case, which makes us extremely sad and disappointed. She is remarkable and deserves this scholarship. She should be able to study abroad freely. We hope that Chevening can help her obtain better treatment and a better life,” said an anonymous Chevening alumnus from China.</p>\n<p>該全球連署除了要求英國外交部旗下的志奮領獎學金發布全球校友信件，比照該獎學金對於其他人權事件的關注，積極呼籲全球志奮領獎學金社群以關注「0919雪餅案」外；更訴求英國外交部及志奮領獎學金針對「0919雪餅案」，展開不限層級的對中人權對話，以保障黃雪琴與王建兵的權利。該全球連署文末，則近一步要求中國當局立即釋放黃雪琴與王建兵。</p>\n<p>The open letter requests the Chevening Scholarship, which is affiliated to the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) to publish a letter to the global alumni community, asking them to show concerns over the “0919 Xuebing case,” as well as to pay more attention to human rights issues in general. In addition, it demands the FCDO and the Chevening leadership to initiate an open dialogue with the Chinese government on this case and to uphold the rights the two detainees deserve. The last part of the letter asks the Chinese authorities to immediately release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>此連署已於2021年12月8日公開在本案件官方網站、twitter以及其臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&amp;Jianbing王建兵」。同時，已於此前透過英國外館寄發至英國外交部與志奮領獎學金秘書處，目前尚無收到任何回應。</p>\n<p>This letter was published on December 8 (GMT+8) on the official website for the “0919 Xuebing case,” as well as on Twitter and the Facebook page “Free Xueqin &amp; Jianbing.” Meanwhile, the letter has been sent to the FCDO and the Chevening Secretariat. No response has been received from them yet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"主要連結：\"><a href=\"#主要連結：\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"主要連結：\"></a>主要連結：</h3><ol>\n<li>「0919雪饼案」官方網站 <a

2021\n\n中文版在最下方\n\n- Call for continued international attention to the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang Xueqin, a Chevening scholar, and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on FCDO and the Chevening leadership for a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on Chevening Leadership to send a Chevening Alumni Email/Letter to the Chevening community to explain the situation of the case of Chevenor Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\nDear Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Chevening Leadership team,\n\nI have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).\n\nWe are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.\n\nHuang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.\n\nCredible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.\n\nWe express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.\n\nChevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.\n\nLast but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

位志奮領學者（Chevenors）發表聯合聲明。\n\n我們對黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵被任意監禁的人權現況，且家屬與律師無法探視的狀況，表示嚴重關切。\n\n黃雪琴是志奮領學者中國2021/22得主，原計劃於今年9月前往英國在薩塞克斯大學就讀研究所學位。她是中國#Metoo運動活動家和獨立調查記者。\n\n國際媒體和持續追蹤此人權個案的臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」發布的可信消息顯示，黃雪琴與好友王建兵於今年9月19日被中國廣東省廣州市警方秘密逮捕，家屬與律師至今未能會見。\n\n我們對中國當局任意逮捕和拘留黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵表示極度關切，因為這似乎只是為了懲罰她和她的同伴的合法人權活動。\n\n志奮領獎學金是世界上最具影響力的獎學金之一，崇尚寬容、公平和社會正義的價值觀。志奮領秘書處透過校友電子郵件，不斷更新志奮領網絡上的精彩故事，也分享了衝突國家的局勢，比如阿富汗的現狀。這些校友郵件為志奮領社區提供了創新理念和世界人權狀況的重要信息。因此，我們敦促志奮領領導與我們站在一起，透過寄發校友郵件，呼籲整體志奮領社區關注黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件。我們敦促志奮領領導層與我們站在一起，公開呼籲釋放志奮領黃雪琴和她的同伴。我們還敦促 FDCO 就黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件，與中國當局展開佈線層級的人權對話。\n\n最後，我們要求中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵。\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

incommunicado detention of Huang Xueqin, a Chevening scholar, and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on FCDO and the Chevening leadership for a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on Chevening Leadership to send a Chevening Alumni Email/Letter to the Chevening community to explain the situation of the case of Chevenor Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\nDear Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Chevening Leadership team,\n\nI have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).\n\nWe are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.\n\nHuang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.\n\nCredible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.\n\nWe express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.\n\nChevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.\n\nLast but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

Press Release](https://github.com/free-xueq-jianb/free-xueq-jianb.github.io/raw/main/docs/20211208%20press_Xuebing.docx)\n\n--- \n\n- 呼籲英國外交部 FCDO 和旗下志奮領總部展開與中國當局針對黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵的人權案件的對話\n- 呼籲志奮領總部向志奮領校友社群發一封校友郵件，說明志奮領獎學金得主黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵的人權案件情況\n- 敦促中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵\n- 呼籲國際社會繼續關注志奮領學者黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵被任意關押的人權現況\n\n\n\n\n尊敬的外交、聯邦和發展辦公室 (FCDO) 和志奮領領導團隊，\n\n我有幸代表 112 位志奮領學者（Chevenors）發表聯合聲明。\n\n我們對黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵被任意監禁的人權現況，且家屬與律師無法探視的狀況，表示嚴重關切。\n\n黃雪琴是志奮領學者中國2021/22得主，原計劃於今年9月前往英國在薩塞克斯大學就讀研究所學位。她是中國#Metoo運動活動家和獨立調查記者。\n\n國際媒體和持續追蹤此人權個案的臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」發布的可信消息顯示，黃雪琴與好友王建兵於今年9月19日被中國廣東省廣州市警方秘密逮捕，家屬與律師至今未能會見。\n\n我們對中國當局任意逮捕和拘留黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵表示極度關切，因為這似乎只是為了懲罰她和她的同伴的合法人權活動。\n\n志奮領獎學金是世界上最具影響力的獎學金之一，崇尚寬容、公平和社會正義的價值觀。志奮領秘書處透過校友電子郵件，不斷更新志奮領網絡上的精彩故事，也分享了衝突國家的局勢，比如阿富汗的現狀。這些校友郵件為志奮領社區提供了創新理念和世界人權狀況的重要信息。因此，我們敦促志奮領領導與我們站在一起，透過寄發校友郵件，呼籲整體志奮領社區關注黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件。我們敦促志奮領領導層與我們站在一起，公開呼籲釋放志奮領黃雪琴和她的同伴。我們還敦促 FDCO 就黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件，與中國當局展開佈線層級的人權對話。\n\n最後，我們要求中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵。\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

team,</p>\n<p>I have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).</p>\n<p>We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Huang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.</p>\n<p>Credible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.</p>\n<p>We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.</p>\n<p>Chevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p><a

位志奮領學者（Chevenors）發表聯合聲明。</p>\n<p>我們對黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵被任意監禁的人權現況，且家屬與律師無法探視的狀況，表示嚴重關切。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴是志奮領學者中國2021/22得主，原計劃於今年9月前往英國在薩塞克斯大學就讀研究所學位。她是中國#Metoo運動活動家和獨立調查記者。</p>\n<p>國際媒體和持續追蹤此人權個案的臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&amp;Jianbing王建兵」發布的可信消息顯示，黃雪琴與好友王建兵於今年9月19日被中國廣東省廣州市警方秘密逮捕，家屬與律師至今未能會見。</p>\n<p>我們對中國當局任意逮捕和拘留黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵表示極度關切，因為這似乎只是為了懲罰她和她的同伴的合法人權活動。</p>\n<p>志奮領獎學金是世界上最具影響力的獎學金之一，崇尚寬容、公平和社會正義的價值觀。志奮領秘書處透過校友電子郵件，不斷更新志奮領網絡上的精彩故事，也分享了衝突國家的局勢，比如阿富汗的現狀。這些校友郵件為志奮領社區提供了創新理念和世界人權狀況的重要信息。因此，我們敦促志奮領領導與我們站在一起，透過寄發校友郵件，呼籲整體志奮領社區關注黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件。我們敦促志奮領領導層與我們站在一起，公開呼籲釋放志奮領黃雪琴和她的同伴。我們還敦促 FDCO 就黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件，與中國當局展開佈線層級的人權對話。</p>\n<p>最後，我們要求中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵。</p>\n<p><a

delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).</p>\n<p>We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Huang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.</p>\n<p>Credible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.</p>\n<p>We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.</p>\n<p>Chevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p><a

My friend, Sophia Huang Xueqin, had marked her 33rd birthday with a series of dinners and parties organised by her friends, complete with barbecue, karaoke, two separate birthday cakes and games of mahjong.\n\n<!-- more --> \n\nThe celebrations felt especially sweet as they were capping two difficult years for her. \n\nA Chinese investigative journalist who had risen to prominence by documenting the #MeToo movement in China, Sophia was coming off a rocky stretch that had included a three-month detention in 2019. \n\nThis was followed by a year and a half of close surveillance by police in her hometown, the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. \n\nNow, she was hoping she could finally leave the country. She had been admitted into a master’s programme at the University of Sussex to study gender, violence and conflict, and secured a prestigious Chevening scholarship, funded by the British government.\n\nThe last missing piece was the police’s approval to fly to Britain. \n\nPolice had told her that once she had her British visa and a plane ticket, she should call them and ask for permission to leave. Sophia was hopeful she would get it.\n\nSo the celebrations at the end of August doubled as a farewell party. “I was surrounded by love and joy, though I also knew I was being watched,” she wrote a few days later on her Facebook page.  \n\nShe received her British visa in early September. A few days later, she had booked a flight, leaving from Hong Kong. She called the police to ask if she could go. The voice on the other end of the phone told her, perhaps surprisingly: \n\n“Sure, you can leave. Would you like us to drive you to the airport?”\n\n“I rejected them nicely,” she told me in a message.\n\nOn September 19, she was planning to travel to the border city of Shenzhen accompanied by a friend, the one-time labour activist Wang Jianbing. From Shenzhen, she was going to cross the border into Hong Kong and board her flight the next day. \n\nBut that afternoon, friends lost contact with both Sophia and Jianbing. Calls and text messages went unanswered. \n\nThey had disappeared.\n\n## Thousands like her\n\nThousands of people disappear annually in China into a system called \"residential surveillance at a designated location\". A law passed in 2013 allows authorities to detain virtually anyone without charges and without notifying family. While more than 27,000 such disappearances have been documented by the Safeguard Defenders nonprofit since 2013, the real number could be much higher.\n\nRecently, the disappearance of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai made international headlines: she vanished from public view last month after accusing a former vice-premier of coercing her into sex. Other high-profile cases from recent years include the temporary disappearances of Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma and Hollywood actress Fan Bingbing. \n\nThousands of lesser-known activists, lawyers, businesspeople and officials have also gone missing. \n\nI reported often on such disappearances during my six years as a China correspondent. But Sophia’s case felt personal.\n\nI met her in December 2017, when I was writing about China’s fledgling #MeToo movement. \n\nShe had decided China needed a reckoning with sexual harassment similar to what the United States was experiencing. In January 2018, she broke the story of an engineer who accused her former professor at a prestigious Beijing school of sexual harassment. \n\nIn the beginning, Sophia was very cautious about not getting in the authorities’ crosshairs. \n\n“You have to think about what’s the safe line and what’s the red line,” she told me in the summer of 2018. “Of course, sometimes you really don’t know where it is until you touch it.”\n\n## The invisible line\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Sophia did unwittingly cross that line. \n\nShe was studying law in Hong Kong and joined the first massive anti-government protest of that summer. She wrote an essay about it, which she distributed on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. \n\nThat same night, around midnight, police turned up simultaneously at her partner’s and parents’ houses in Guangdong province, where Guangzhou is located, with the intent to take her away from wherever she was staying.  \n\nThey didn’t get her that evening, but she was detained in October 2019, when she returned to Guangzhou to renew her documents so she could continue her studies in Hong Kong. \n\nThe charge authorities eventually brought against her was “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” Sophia never spoke publicly about her detention but was planning to if authorities did prevent her from going to Britain, she told me. Even if that wouldn’t have secured her freedom, she wanted to hold them accountable.\n\nShe was held at a villa in Guangzhou, the location of which was unknown to her family and lawyers. During her months in detention, two police officers would stare at her for hours and scribble notes while she sat on a couch or walked around the room. \n\nShe was frequently interrogated.

My friend, Sophia Huang Xueqin, had marked her 33rd birthday with a series of dinners and parties organised by her friends, complete with barbecue, karaoke, two separate birthday cakes and games of mahjong.\n\n<!-- more --> \n\nThe celebrations felt especially sweet as they were capping two difficult years for her. \n\nA Chinese investigative journalist who had risen to prominence by documenting the #MeToo movement in China, Sophia was coming off a rocky stretch that had included a three-month detention in 2019. \n\nThis was followed by a year and a half of close surveillance by police in her hometown, the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. \n\nNow, she was hoping she could finally leave the country. She had been admitted into a master’s programme at the University of Sussex to study gender, violence and conflict, and secured a prestigious Chevening scholarship, funded by the British government.\n\nThe last missing piece was the police’s approval to fly to Britain. \n\nPolice had told her that once she had her British visa and a plane ticket, she should call them and ask for permission to leave. Sophia was hopeful she would get it.\n\nSo the celebrations at the end of August doubled as a farewell party. “I was surrounded by love and joy, though I also knew I was being watched,” she wrote a few days later on her Facebook page.  \n\nShe received her British visa in early September. A few days later, she had booked a flight, leaving from Hong Kong. She called the police to ask if she could go. The voice on the other end of the phone told her, perhaps surprisingly: \n\n“Sure, you can leave. Would you like us to drive you to the airport?”\n\n“I rejected them nicely,” she told me in a message.\n\nOn September 19, she was planning to travel to the border city of Shenzhen accompanied by a friend, the one-time labour activist Wang Jianbing. From Shenzhen, she was going to cross the border into Hong Kong and board her flight the next day. \n\nBut that afternoon, friends lost contact with both Sophia and Jianbing. Calls and text messages went unanswered. \n\nThey had disappeared.\n\n## Thousands like her\n\nThousands of people disappear annually in China into a system called \"residential surveillance at a designated location\". A law passed in 2013 allows authorities to detain virtually anyone without charges and without notifying family. While more than 27,000 such disappearances have been documented by the Safeguard Defenders nonprofit since 2013, the real number could be much higher.\n\nRecently, the disappearance of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai made international headlines: she vanished from public view last month after accusing a former vice-premier of coercing her into sex. Other high-profile cases from recent years include the temporary disappearances of Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma and Hollywood actress Fan Bingbing. \n\nThousands of lesser-known activists, lawyers, businesspeople and officials have also gone missing. \n\nI reported often on such disappearances during my six years as a China correspondent. But Sophia’s case felt personal.\n\nI met her in December 2017, when I was writing about China’s fledgling #MeToo movement. \n\nShe had decided China needed a reckoning with sexual harassment similar to what the United States was experiencing. In January 2018, she broke the story of an engineer who accused her former professor at a prestigious Beijing school of sexual harassment. \n\nIn the beginning, Sophia was very cautious about not getting in the authorities’ crosshairs. \n\n“You have to think about what’s the safe line and what’s the red line,” she told me in the summer of 2018. “Of course, sometimes you really don’t know where it is until you touch it.”\n\n## The invisible line\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Sophia did unwittingly cross that line. \n\nShe was studying law in Hong Kong and joined the first massive anti-government protest of that summer. She wrote an essay about it, which she distributed on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. \n\nThat same night, around midnight, police turned up simultaneously at her partner’s and parents’ houses in Guangdong province, where Guangzhou is located, with the intent to take her away from wherever she was staying.  \n\nThey didn’t get her that evening, but she was detained in October 2019, when she returned to Guangzhou to renew her documents so she could continue her studies in Hong Kong. \n\nThe charge authorities eventually brought against her was “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” Sophia never spoke publicly about her detention but was planning to if authorities did prevent her from going to Britain, she told me. Even if that wouldn’t have secured her freedom, she wanted to hold them accountable.\n\nShe was held at a villa in Guangzhou, the location of which was unknown to her family and lawyers. During her months in detention, two police officers would stare at her for hours and scribble notes while she sat on a couch or walked around the room. \n\nShe was frequently interrogated. On occasion, police would sit her down and dissect passages from her diaries. They threatened to throw her into prison for many years. They tried to extract a written confession – a common practice in cases considered politically sensitive by authorities – but Sophia refused and insisted journalism was not a crime. \n\n## Making her life hell\n\nAfter her release, in January 2020, police asked that they meet monthly for dinners at some of the fanciest restaurants in Guangzhou, she told me.

\"Xuebing\") are an independent journalist and labour activist in mainland China, respectively. They were taken from their homes by the police in September 2021 and are currently being held in secret detention. In the past three months since their disappearance, the police did not inform their families of the charges, nor did they give the families a notice, while asking the families to keep quiet and summoning their friends to make false statements, deliberately framing them for \"inciting subversion of state power”.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nIt has been more than three months since Xuebing disappeared. Lawyers still have not been able to see them, and their actual place of detention remains unknown. We are a group of friends of Xuebing and would like to initiate a postcard campaign at the end of 2021, inviting everyone to send postcards to Xuebing.\n\nWhether you know them in person or not, and whether these postcards will actually be delivered to them or not, the action itself is significantly meaningful and can help critically improve their situations — it is a gesture to tell the authorities that we are strongly concerned about Xuebing’s conditions, and we are closely watching what injustice and illegality you have done to our friends!\n\nWe invite everyone to join our campaign. It can be a New Year's greeting or just a simple wish to Xuebing, or a protest to the police.

Download address: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ng0yCOj7q_MNbwxyItvaMzqwuH96kZiX?usp=sharing\n\n2.

Pick up a postcard in assigned locations(Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris only) , fill it out and take a photo for us, then mail it. The pick up location of the postcard will be updated on this page.\nLondon: please contact xuebinglondon@gmail.com to pick up postcards.\nParis: please contact huxiu1912@gmail.com to pick up postcards.\n\n4.

of the Ox. As fate would have it, the same astrological sign that brought a dear friend into my life snatched him away mercilessly when it returned twelve years later.\n\nI remember that day as if it were yesterday. Jianbing was getting up from a bunk bed in the hostel dormitory where we were both staying at the time. He was intrigued by this foreigner arriving with a Beijing colleague, and was relieved to learn that said foreigner could speak enough Mandarin to communicate with those around him.\n\nJianbing was born in rural Gansu. The first in his family to get a college degree, he made the brave choice to work at a non-profit, the Beijing Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation, instead of landing a more secure and well-paid job in an average urban company. He joined the foundation’s kindergarten program so that he could help kids from rural areas access a better education than the one he had himself.\n\nHe is a soft-spoken and highly reflective person who always knows how to make people comfortable through simple gestures and glances. I’ve always admired his open-mindedness, his ability to listen and ponder things before making any judgment. Unlike many of the other Chinese activists I have met over the years, Jianbing is fond of Chinese classical culture, and while he was at university, he taught himself to sing several different provincial styles of Chinese opera just from listening to them online. It wasn’t uncommon for him to start singing an opera or reciting a Tang poem while walking the streets of Beijing or Lanzhou, ignoring the bewildered looks of passers-by.\n\nAfter our encounter in Gansu, life sent us on different paths for a few years, but we kept in touch through common friends. When we met again, it was in a different China. General Secretary Xi Jinping had replaced Hu Jintao. Many activists had been jailed. NGOs and intellectuals once praised by the regime were shut down and censored. But Jianbing was still himself, slightly more pessimistic, but calm and convinced that China needed people to tell the stories of sick migrant workers, oppressed women, and traumatized activists.\n\nHe did not deny the real material progress China has made, a progress he could very well see in his hometown, where kids had food to eat, clothes to wear, and toys to play with—a far cry from his own childhood. But he sensed that this progress came at the expense of other marginalized groups, groups the government deliberately ignored, hid, or jailed as if they were blemishes on an otherwise spotless record. He was also angry that even those who enjoyed the benefits of such progress had to continually praise the Party and the government for their great bounty.\n\nHe felt there were many issues that couldn’t be solved by simply building glimmering high-speed rail lines or enabling consumerism in once-deprived rural areas. Among them: the fate of migrant workers, whom he had come to deeply understand in the previous few years, as well as the treatment of sexual harassment victims, which had made him a staunch supporter of the #MeToo movement.\n\nOne of the last times we spoke, I had already sensed that things were getting worse in China, and I reluctantly suggested that he should write down his fascinating life story—even if he was only 38 years old, and even if it were only for himself.\n\nI will never forget his answer: “You know there’s nothing special to write about me. I’m just an ordinary Chinese activist. Many of the companions (xiao huoban) around me are much braver and have much more interesting stories to tell.”\n\nI hope we’ll soon be able to pick up our conversation again, drinking tea, eating sunflower seeds, and laughing as we did in that dim hostel dormitory on a cold Gansu night twelve years ago.\n\n[Source](https://www.chinafile.com/ngo/latest/tribute-ordinary-chinese-activist)\n","source":"_posts/ordinary_chinese_activist.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【ChinaFile】Tribute to an ‘Ordinary Chinese Activist’\ndate: 2022-01-27T10:39:44.293Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/VZidzeJ.png\ncategories:\n  - 媒体报道\ntags:\n  - English\n---\nI first met Jianbing on a cold Gansu winter day over twelve years ago, in the Year of the Ox.

Open Letter to the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom in Support of HUANG Xueqin, a #Metoo Activist and Independent Journalist from China by Feminist Scholars Based in the UK\n\nDear Mr.Zheng Zeguang, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom,\n\nI have the honour of delivering this open letter on behalf of 55 feminists based in the UK.\n\nWe are gravely concerned about the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of HUANG Xueqin. HUANG Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who had planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in September 2021. She is a leading #MeToo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China, whose inspiring life story is recorded in the article ‘Huang Xueqin: How could a journalist keep silent?’. [1]\n\nInternational media has reported that HUANG Xueqin, together with her friend WANG Jianbing, a labour rights activist and #MeToo supporter, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China on 19 September 2021.[2] This occurred one day before Xueqin’s departure to take up her scholarship in the UK. Both remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared. A group of volunteers set up a website to update their situation. [3]\n \nWe express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chinese feminist, Xueqin. This arrest seems to be only aimed at punishing her for her human rights activism. Such an act of repression is utterly shocking and unacceptable. \n\nAs feminists based in the UK, we deeply appreciate Xueqin’s great contributions to both the Chinese and international #MeToo movement. We have been anticipating Xueqin’s arrival to UK to share her experiences and knowledge in feminist activism and journalism. It is disappointing that the University of Sussex and Chevening Scholarship have not released any public statement regarding the situation of Xueqin. We believe that her endeavours to promote awareness of sexual harassment and the need for gender equality should be honoured and remembered rather than being censored.\n\nWe stand in solidarity with our feminist sister: HUANG Xueqin. In the knowledge that it is extremely politically high-risk for Chinese feminists to openly voice their concern, we speak out as an international feminist community and hope feminists in the UK can join us to call for Xueqin and Jianbing’s release. We invite anyone who is deeply concerned with feminism, labour rights issues and civil society in China to sign this open letter.\n\nWe strongly urge Chinese authorities to disclose the whereabouts of HUANG Xueqin and WANG Jianbing and release them immediately and unconditionally.\n\nCOSIGNATORIES (This list is arranged according to alphabetical order)\n\n    1.

HUANG Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who had planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in September 2021. She is a leading #MeToo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China, whose inspiring life story is recorded in the article ‘Huang Xueqin: How could a journalist keep silent?’. [1]</p>\n<p>International media has reported that HUANG Xueqin, together with her friend WANG Jianbing, a labour rights activist and #MeToo supporter, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China on 19 September 2021.[2] This occurred one day before Xueqin’s departure to take up her scholarship in the UK. Both remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared. A group of volunteers set up a website to update their situation. [3]</p>\n<p>We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chinese feminist, Xueqin. This arrest seems to be only aimed at punishing her for her human rights activism. Such an act of repression is utterly shocking and unacceptable. </p>\n<p>As feminists based in the UK, we deeply appreciate Xueqin’s great contributions to both the Chinese and international #MeToo movement. We have been anticipating Xueqin’s arrival to UK to share her experiences and knowledge in feminist activism and journalism. It is disappointing that the University of Sussex and Chevening Scholarship have not released any public statement regarding the situation of Xueqin. We believe that her endeavours to promote awareness of sexual harassment and the need for gender equality should be honoured and remembered rather than being censored.</p>\n<p>We stand in solidarity with our feminist sister: HUANG Xueqin. In the knowledge that it is extremely politically high-risk for Chinese feminists to openly voice their concern, we speak out as an international feminist community and hope feminists in the UK can join us to call for Xueqin and Jianbing’s release. We invite anyone who is deeply concerned with feminism, labour rights issues and civil society in China to sign this open letter.</p>\n<p>We strongly urge Chinese authorities to disclose the whereabouts of HUANG Xueqin and WANG Jianbing and release them immediately and unconditionally.</p>\n<p>COSIGNATORIES (This list is arranged according to alphabetical order)</p>\n<pre><code>1.
