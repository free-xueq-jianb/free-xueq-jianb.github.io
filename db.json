It will provide a comprehensive account of the secret arrest of \"Xuebing\", as well as the ongoing progress of the case. We hope that friends from civil society community, media, and international community could continue to stay tuned, and support Huang and Wang. We urge the Guangzhou police to release them unconditionally. This document will be continuously updated (by 2021.11.19).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## 发生了什么？What Happened?\n\n2021年9月19日下午，女权记者黄雪琴、职业病权益倡导者王建兵（昵称“煎饼”）于王建兵住处失联。后经确认，两人于当天下午3点左右被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动国家政权罪”抓捕，并疑对双方采取了“指定居所监视居住”（RSDL)，但警方并未给家属寄送法律规定的通知书。黄雪琴原计划于9月20日经深圳前往香港机场，飞赴英国留学，而王建兵则原计划于当天给其送行。据知情人士确认，目前黄雪琴被关押在广州第二看守所、王建兵被关押在广州市第一看守所，家属无法向两人汇款，至今两人的身心健康状况仍不明确。\n\nFeminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease advocate Wang Jianbing (nicknamed \"pancake\", pronounced as \"Jianbing\" in Mandarin Chinese) were secretly taken away, last seen at Wang Jianbing's apartment, since the afternoon of September 19, 2021. It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。\n\nLatest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\". Previously, on November 5, 2021, Wang Jianbing's family also received an \"arrest notice\" from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, indicating that Wang Jianbing was detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center for \"inciting subversion of state power.\n\n此外，在11月王建兵家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. \n- 2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.\" The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.\n- 2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n- 2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the \"New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing\" campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police's malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.\n- 2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist & independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center. She have been forcibly disappeared since Sept 19,2021, under the illegitimate charge of inciting subversion of state power. HuangXueqin was unable to be represented or visited by lawyers and her physical and mental health conditions is still unknown. It was previously confirmed that her fellow, the labor activist WangJianbing is held at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, under the same charge with her.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。\n\nLatest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\". Previously, on November 5, 2021, Wang Jianbing's family also received an \"arrest notice\" from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, indicating that Wang Jianbing was detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center for \"inciting subversion of state power.\n\n此外，在11月王建兵家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment.

They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour.

The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.\" The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.\n- 2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n- 2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the \"New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing\" campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police's malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.\n- 2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist & independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center.

HuangXueqin was unable to be represented or visited by lawyers and her physical and mental health conditions is still unknown. It was previously confirmed that her fellow, the labor activist WangJianbing is held at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, under the same charge with her.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent. The IFJ stands in solidarity with Huang, who has faced continual harassment by Chinese authorities for drawing attention to important issues in the public interest.””\n\n4. **Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中国人权捍卫者）**: China: immediately release #MeToo activist and fellow civil society advocate, 2021.09.21, https://www.nchrd.org/2021/09/china-immediately-release-metoo-activist-and-fellow-civil-society-advocate/\n\n> “A journalist and an activist have gone missing for two days from the southern provincial capital of Guangzhou.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years.

Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of “inciting subversion of state power”.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police.

They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: “We can’t confirm the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.” </li>\n<li>2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang’d family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.” The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.</li>\n<li>2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.</li>\n<li>2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the “New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing” campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police’s malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.</li>\n<li>2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist &amp; independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.</p>\n<p>黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关<a href=\"https://matters.news/@sophia/%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84-%E5%8F%8D%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD-%E5%A4%A7%E6%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA\">文章</a>，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.</p>\n<h2 id=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\"><a href=\"#抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\"></a>抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?</h2><p>自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：<strong>王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。</strong>警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。</p>\n<p>Since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022-01-25-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2022.01.25) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：2022年1月25日，据知情人士确认，黄雪琴现正被关押于广州市第二看守所(白云区石井镇潭岗村)，罪名为“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”。此前，2021年的11月5日，王建兵家属也收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，显示王建兵因“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”被拘留于广州市第一看守所。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: On January 25, 2022, informed sources confirmed that Huang Xueqin is now being held at the Guangzhou Second Detention Center (Tangang Village, Shijing Town, Baiyun District) on charges of “inciting subversion of state power”.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. </li>\n<li>Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. </li>\n<li>2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: “We can’t confirm the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.” </li>\n<li>2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang’d family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.” The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.</li>\n<li>2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.</li>\n<li>2021/12/26 Supporters of the 919 Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing case launched the “New Year will be bright, send a postcard to XueBing” campaign, with supporters from various cities of China Mainland, Taipei, Hong Kong, London, and Paris writing postcards and sending them to the Guangzhou City Detention Center, where the two are being held, to express their protest against the police’s malicious arrests and their thoughts for XueBing.</li>\n<li>2022/1/25 Chinese MeToo activist &amp; independent journalist HuangXueqin is known to be officially held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center. She have been forcibly disappeared since Sept 19,2021, under the illegitimate charge of inciting subversion of state power. HuangXueqin was unable to be represented or visited by lawyers and her physical and mental health conditions is still unknown. It was previously confirmed that her fellow, the labor activist WangJianbing is held at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, under the same charge with her.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\"><a href=\"#国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\"></a>国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity</h2><ol>\n<li><strong>Amnesty International (国际特赦)</strong>: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/\">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/</a> </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others.

more -->\n\n作为一名研究中外女权历史的学者，密切关注中国各年龄群各领域中为推进男女平等改造男权文化在台前幕后做不懈努力的人群是我的职业习惯。自2018年元旦互联网上爆出罗茜茜实名举报北航教授陈小武性骚扰事件那刻起，我就在跟踪事态的发展。2014年就有研究生在网上揭露厦门大学教授吴春明性骚扰，当时全国各地高校老师2百多人联名签署呼吁教育部建立高校反性骚扰机制并要求厦大调查和处理吴春明性骚扰案。而18年元旦则是被侵犯者罗茜茜实名公开举报，这在中国漫长的男权文化历史中是开天辟地头一回。\n\n曾几何时，被性侵的女人要么跳井要么上吊，才能保全自己和家族的名节。贞操 -中国女人的首要美德- 这副沉重的枷锁迄今依然禁锢着现代社会中的女人。被权势男人猥亵了侵犯了，女人，尤其是处于弱势的青年女子，最普遍的反应是独自默默忍受屈辱的创痛。若有报警也多要求匿名保密，以免影响到家人和自己后面的人生。性侵犯的罪责，在男权文化根深蒂固的这个国度中，理所当然地让女人来承担着，被侵害的女人一旦被人知晓，便成了刺着红字的所谓失贞的女人，在世人鄙夷的目光中度日成为另类。\n\n正因为深知中国女人背负的沉重的男权历史文化枷锁和今日面对的“潜规则”陷阱，罗茜茜实名举报使我激动。紧接着发生的一个又一个的青年女子的实名举报和一波又一波的联名呼吁高校建立反性骚扰机制，都明明白白地告诉我，被罗茜茜的勇敢所激励的远不止我这个女权学者。年轻一代女性揭竿而起了，拒不接受被侮辱与被损害的弱者地位，正在以大写的人的精神面貌站起来勇敢地维护女人的尊严，来改造自己身处的视女人为玩物、性工具和生育机器的男权文化。\n\n后来我了解到记者黄雪琴与罗茜茜联手，事先做了大量严谨的调查核实工作，才形成我们后来看到的证据确凿资料翔实丰富的调查报告。这个重大热点新闻事件与这位记者的参与密不可分。后来有机会见到她，发现这是一位才华出众思维敏捷正义感和公民责任感极强的记者，是当今社会里的佼佼者。我特意用“佼佼者”来形容雪琴，为了区别于“精英”这个折射着附庸权贵攀附金钱意像的词。\n\n当今社会制造了大量的“精英”却容不得佼佼者，因为后者有独立思考的能力和言行一致的行动力。后者是在草根在各自的社会位置上在每日实践中为了无权势的小人物的尊严和权利不顾艰难险阻地努力着的人群，ta们一般不为公众所知。雪琴因为是记者，她那有话语权的职业使她引起同行的关注。 她一系列杰出的调查报告为她赢得了2019年和2020年国内的优秀媒体人奖，2021年又获得了两项国际大奖：国际特赦颁发的人权新闻奖，和亚洲出版社颁发的卓越新闻奖。在正常的情况下，雪琴应该被看作是“为国争光”的优秀记者。\n\n在不正常的情况下，自18年元旦起各地青年女性自发的一波又一波的公开举报被维稳部门视为社会不安定因素，并企图定义为是“海外敌对势力”煽动起来的。这种认知不仅暴露了权势男性对当今青年女性困境的无知和漠视，也折射出崇洋媚外的心态，似乎中国女人是不具有能动性来伸张正义争取自己的权益的，若有什么维护平等权益的行动则必定是外人挑唆操纵的结果。这种莫须有的“阶级斗争”思维模式开始把积极参与维护妇女权益活动的女权人士纳入维稳对象。很快雪琴就因为她在反性骚扰活动中的重要作用被频频“喝茶”，家人也经常被骚扰。但雪琴是那种“身正不怕影子斜”的人，她不会因为外界或官方对她的污名或压力而改变自己坚守的正义感和责任感。她忠于自己作为一个记者的职业道德和操守，继续写出一篇篇往往不被主流许可的调查报告或人物专访。终于她对香港反送中大规模活动的实地报道触犯天条，在2019年10月被广州公安局以“寻事滋事”罪名拘留，[于2020年1月被释放](https://chinesefeminism.org/2019/11/11/中国米兔运动推手黄雪琴遭拘留/)。\n\n这几个月的恐吓惩罚的内容除了让雪琴失去人身自由几个月以及给家人带来极大的精神压力，还让雪琴失去了全奖在香港大学法律研究所就读硕士学位的机会。作为一名优秀的记者转而要去学法律，显然是看到可以深入地报道社会真实状况的空间实在有限，也许读法律更能帮助被侵害者伸张正义。但这条路也给堵死了。不过对雪琴来说，人生是具有多种可能性的，只要自己不放弃探索。读不成法律并没有影响雪琴对性骚扰幸存者的援助。众多的被侵害青年女性寻求她的帮助，雪琴替她们寻找律师和心理咨询师，陪伴她们走出人生低谷。同时雪琴继续寻找其它深造的机会。2021年她获得了英国志奋领奖学金并被英国萨塞克斯大学的硕士项目录取。公安局发回了19年拘留时扣压的护照，她办妥了签证，却在离家去英国留学之际与送她的朋友一起失联了。\n\n我无法想象两个绝非富豪的成年人会在大城市被黑社会绑票，那种想象既缺乏逻辑基础也是对中国公安干警治安能力的贬低。且不说那遍布大街小巷以及所有公共空间的摄像头岂不白装了？我也不愿相信是维稳部门干的，他们若不想让雪琴出国留学，扣她的护照即可实现。有正当拘捕理由，哪天都可以上门去亮出拘捕证按法律程序逮捕。维稳部门应该是把国家利益看作至高无上的，怎么会用这种歹毒下三滥的手法给国家机器抹黑啊！他们当然知道雪琴是今年获得国际大奖的记者，难道就不能想象她的媒体同行们肯定会关注她的行踪？遍及世界各地的记者是不受中国公安管辖的。这不，她的失联已经被海外中英文各种媒体广泛报道。公安部们制造事端抹黑国家机器在国际上的形象，实在不符合逻辑啊！那又是什么邪恶势力要用黑社会的手法来对待两个青年人呢？\n\n在缺乏任何信息的情况下，我无法判断究竟谁在犯罪。想起了电视剧《扫黑风暴》中主人公的一句意味深长的台词：“你怎么知道谁是好人谁是坏人啊？”\n\n我唯一能确定的是：失联的雪琴是难能可贵的佼佼者。我会时时牵挂着她，期盼着她的平安归来。\n\n附录：黄雪琴评论弦子案二次开庭 （2021年9月16日周四）\n\n> **弦子的案子是弦子的，也是中国女人们的，到了这一步，仍以“胜”或“负”的二元叙事来总结显得太肤浅，且陷入官方的权威叙事里。从2018年1月1日以来，#MeToo 走过了中国的三年，带来的影响和变化远在所谓的司法“胜负”之外。这三年我们看着浪潮起起伏伏，看着幸存者们负伤前行，看着姐妹情谊的链接，看着一个个幸存者如何成长和蜕变…

-中国女人的首要美德- 这副沉重的枷锁迄今依然禁锢着现代社会中的女人。被权势男人猥亵了侵犯了，女人，尤其是处于弱势的青年女子，最普遍的反应是独自默默忍受屈辱的创痛。若有报警也多要求匿名保密，以免影响到家人和自己后面的人生。性侵犯的罪责，在男权文化根深蒂固的这个国度中，理所当然地让女人来承担着，被侵害的女人一旦被人知晓，便成了刺着红字的所谓失贞的女人，在世人鄙夷的目光中度日成为另类。</p>\n<p>正因为深知中国女人背负的沉重的男权历史文化枷锁和今日面对的“潜规则”陷阱，罗茜茜实名举报使我激动。紧接着发生的一个又一个的青年女子的实名举报和一波又一波的联名呼吁高校建立反性骚扰机制，都明明白白地告诉我，被罗茜茜的勇敢所激励的远不止我这个女权学者。年轻一代女性揭竿而起了，拒不接受被侮辱与被损害的弱者地位，正在以大写的人的精神面貌站起来勇敢地维护女人的尊严，来改造自己身处的视女人为玩物、性工具和生育机器的男权文化。</p>\n<p>后来我了解到记者黄雪琴与罗茜茜联手，事先做了大量严谨的调查核实工作，才形成我们后来看到的证据确凿资料翔实丰富的调查报告。这个重大热点新闻事件与这位记者的参与密不可分。后来有机会见到她，发现这是一位才华出众思维敏捷正义感和公民责任感极强的记者，是当今社会里的佼佼者。我特意用“佼佼者”来形容雪琴，为了区别于“精英”这个折射着附庸权贵攀附金钱意像的词。</p>\n<p>当今社会制造了大量的“精英”却容不得佼佼者，因为后者有独立思考的能力和言行一致的行动力。后者是在草根在各自的社会位置上在每日实践中为了无权势的小人物的尊严和权利不顾艰难险阻地努力着的人群，ta们一般不为公众所知。雪琴因为是记者，她那有话语权的职业使她引起同行的关注。 她一系列杰出的调查报告为她赢得了2019年和2020年国内的优秀媒体人奖，2021年又获得了两项国际大奖：国际特赦颁发的人权新闻奖，和亚洲出版社颁发的卓越新闻奖。在正常的情况下，雪琴应该被看作是“为国争光”的优秀记者。</p>\n<p>在不正常的情况下，自18年元旦起各地青年女性自发的一波又一波的公开举报被维稳部门视为社会不安定因素，并企图定义为是“海外敌对势力”煽动起来的。这种认知不仅暴露了权势男性对当今青年女性困境的无知和漠视，也折射出崇洋媚外的心态，似乎中国女人是不具有能动性来伸张正义争取自己的权益的，若有什么维护平等权益的行动则必定是外人挑唆操纵的结果。这种莫须有的“阶级斗争”思维模式开始把积极参与维护妇女权益活动的女权人士纳入维稳对象。很快雪琴就因为她在反性骚扰活动中的重要作用被频频“喝茶”，家人也经常被骚扰。但雪琴是那种“身正不怕影子斜”的人，她不会因为外界或官方对她的污名或压力而改变自己坚守的正义感和责任感。她忠于自己作为一个记者的职业道德和操守，继续写出一篇篇往往不被主流许可的调查报告或人物专访。终于她对香港反送中大规模活动的实地报道触犯天条，在2019年10月被广州公安局以“寻事滋事”罪名拘留，<a href=\"https://chinesefeminism.org/2019/11/11/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E7%B1%B3%E5%85%94%E8%BF%90%E5%8A%A8%E6%8E%A8%E6%89%8B%E9%BB%84%E9%9B%AA%E7%90%B4%E9%81%AD%E6%8B%98%E7%95%99/\">于2020年1月被释放</a>。</p>\n<p>这几个月的恐吓惩罚的内容除了让雪琴失去人身自由几个月以及给家人带来极大的精神压力，还让雪琴失去了全奖在香港大学法律研究所就读硕士学位的机会。作为一名优秀的记者转而要去学法律，显然是看到可以深入地报道社会真实状况的空间实在有限，也许读法律更能帮助被侵害者伸张正义。但这条路也给堵死了。不过对雪琴来说，人生是具有多种可能性的，只要自己不放弃探索。读不成法律并没有影响雪琴对性骚扰幸存者的援助。众多的被侵害青年女性寻求她的帮助，雪琴替她们寻找律师和心理咨询师，陪伴她们走出人生低谷。同时雪琴继续寻找其它深造的机会。2021年她获得了英国志奋领奖学金并被英国萨塞克斯大学的硕士项目录取。公安局发回了19年拘留时扣压的护照，她办妥了签证，却在离家去英国留学之际与送她的朋友一起失联了。</p>\n<p>我无法想象两个绝非富豪的成年人会在大城市被黑社会绑票，那种想象既缺乏逻辑基础也是对中国公安干警治安能力的贬低。且不说那遍布大街小巷以及所有公共空间的摄像头岂不白装了？我也不愿相信是维稳部门干的，他们若不想让雪琴出国留学，扣她的护照即可实现。有正当拘捕理由，哪天都可以上门去亮出拘捕证按法律程序逮捕。维稳部门应该是把国家利益看作至高无上的，怎么会用这种歹毒下三滥的手法给国家机器抹黑啊！他们当然知道雪琴是今年获得国际大奖的记者，难道就不能想象她的媒体同行们肯定会关注她的行踪？遍及世界各地的记者是不受中国公安管辖的。这不，她的失联已经被海外中英文各种媒体广泛报道。公安部们制造事端抹黑国家机器在国际上的形象，实在不符合逻辑啊！那又是什么邪恶势力要用黑社会的手法来对待两个青年人呢？</p>\n<p>在缺乏任何信息的情况下，我无法判断究竟谁在犯罪。想起了电视剧《扫黑风暴》中主人公的一句意味深长的台词：“你怎么知道谁是好人谁是坏人啊？”</p>\n<p>我唯一能确定的是：失联的雪琴是难能可贵的佼佼者。我会时时牵挂着她，期盼着她的平安归来。</p>\n<p>附录：黄雪琴评论弦子案二次开庭 （2021年9月16日周四）</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>弦子的案子是弦子的，也是中国女人们的，到了这一步，仍以“胜”或“负”的二元叙事来总结显得太肤浅，且陷入官方的权威叙事里。从2018年1月1日以来，#MeToo 走过了中国的三年，带来的影响和变化远在所谓的司法“胜负”之外。这三年我们看着浪潮起起伏伏，看着幸存者们负伤前行，看着姐妹情谊的链接，看着一个个幸存者如何成长和蜕变…

Born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province. Independent activist. He has been involved in non-profit work for over 16 years . His friends prefer to call him \"pancake\" as his nickname. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Beijing Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation and ran rural development projects, which kicked off his career as a non-profit worker who cares deeply about the education and development of the youth. He was the project manager of rural education program at Western Sunshine Foundation for 5 years.  In 2014, He joined GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development in Guangzhou as the project manager and coordinator of the youth development project as well as the disabled community empowerment project. Since 2018, he has been undertaking rights advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases, such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support for them. Wang also participated in supporting the #MeToo movement in China.\n\nHuang Xueqin, born in 1988 in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province. Independent journalist. She worked as an investigative journalist for News Express and Southern Metropolis Weekly, . She wrote on topics related to gender, equal rights, government corruption, corporate pollution, and other marginalized groups. She has also participated in many #MeToo cases and campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims in sexual assault and harassment cases. Huang Xueqin had planned to go to the University of Hong Kong to obtain a Master’s degree in Law in 2019. Her study plan was disrupted when she was abruptly detained by the Guangzhou police on October 17th, 2019 for the charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”.

运动轰轰烈烈如火如荼，彼时，雪琴似利刃出鞘一般，跟进报道了好几宗#Metoo事件，比如中大张鹏性骚扰女学生的事情。报道出来后，张鹏一度表示要追究雪琴的法律责任，雪琴便写了一封公开信，喊话“承担我们各自应该承担的法律责任吧，也好为我国‘反性骚扰法’贡献一个案例和一份力量”。而那个时候我正在休养，没有参与运动中的任何行动。我不抱希望地问她要不要一见，觉得她应该不太记得我。但雪琴一口就答应了，在她开会的午休间隙，我们约在市中心的一家日本餐馆见面。雪琴还是一副快言快语的样子，告诉我，开会期间她怎么带领一帮有语言障碍的女性一起外出行动（就是觅食）。还有别的一些激动人心的收获。那天刮风降温，我出门穿少了在她开会的间隙，我在回去的公交车上瑟瑟发抖，却有些他乡重逢故人知己的喜悦和畅快，浑然不知自己把铅笔袋弄丢了。\n\n此后，我们便不曾见面，但线上偶有联系。看到她还是那样，认准了什么事就一定要做，坚决而明确。那时我还不知道，她因为深感做记者的空间有限，已决心转到法律，只记得她一直在公共平台上发声，尽记者的本分，记录、调查、报道。直到一年后（2019年）的10月中下旬，我得知她失联的消息。想起她站在明亮的舞台上、接受主流媒体的注目也就是不久之前的事，她却非要执着地做下去；转眼间，她却已被迫陷入黑暗和沉寂。这是不是“傻”？ 。朋友安慰我（这不是什么太好的安慰）：这也许是她已经反复想过的，她在迈出那一步的时候就已经设想过了这种可能。我难过至极，带着一种看见明星陨落的心情。\n\n在她第一次消失的日子里，我把她举着metoo牌子的海报贴在自己书桌前方的墙上，我一抬头就可以看见。我把这张海报的复制件贴在合租房公共空间的门上，夜里到校园贴在建筑物的墙上。我去她的社交账号上找她的照片给朋友们做海报，发现原来她在很多照片上也是穿白衬衫牛仔裤的，爽朗明快； 她跟世界各地的朋友们合影，穿着秀气的旗袍却是爽朗地笑着，一下子让人想起那天她描述自己帮一群女士出行的画面。她就是这样爽朗热情，生机勃勃的，像极了她微信上的那一大片灿烂蓬勃的野菊。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kjGLMvV.jpg)\n\n<center>这就是那张海报上的照片</center>\n\n后来，她回来了，第一句话便是“一秒钟的黑暗不会让人成为瞎子。” 过了很久之后，我终于能跟她联系了。我搬了家，海报贴在新房间的墙上，拍给她看。她说：“谢谢你。”我扔掉了海报，觉得终于不用每天看着海报想着她怎么样了。\n\n她重获自由之后，我们继续点赞和评论之交。我仔细放大她社交媒体上的照片，却看不见她的脸上的疲惫和松垮。她给自己起名黄小懒，却始终勤奋地工作（写稿），尽管这些稿件一再地让她被喝茶、威胁。她依旧是那个执着的“傻瓜”，认准的事她便继续去做；工作之余，她又一次申请了读书，时不时地，还和朋友聚会喝酒、打麻将、爬山、泡温泉。她还时常出没在伙伴们的评论区，给她们远程发射拥抱，热情邀请她们一起。她得知我要到广州，招呼我一起喝酒、搓麻将、爬山；之后又有好几次，她在我情绪低落的po文里给我留言，还提到去煎饼家看电影放松继续邀请我。我始终因为社交恐惧和家事拖累没有成行，总觉得有些对不住她的盛情。\n\n她以前我认识的黄雪琴，就是没有架子的。哪怕像我这样只见过一两次面的人，她也能时刻敞开她内心最真诚热情的一面，热情邀请我进入她的生活，她的世界。 无论是对性骚扰的受害人，还是开会时仅仅共处即日的同行者，她也总是无条件地提供帮助，似乎没有时间和精力的“底线。在第一次遭遇指定地点监视居住的数月后，她没有变，反而越来越多地给我们这些没有经历过她遭遇的人，提供温情的鼓励。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9hgk1BR.jpg)\n\n<center>雪琴在打麻将</center>\n\n然而，这个诚挚、温和、爽朗、利落的人，又一次失去了自由。\n\n> 事件背景：9月19日下午3点前后，广州警方强行将王建兵和即将出国留学的黄雪琴带走。据多方了解，警方疑已对两人采取指定地点监视居住，被抓原因或涉及日常的朋友聚会。警察多次传唤两人的朋友，要求他们指控两人涉嫌组织有关时政讨论类的活动。黄雪琴本已获英国志奋领奖学金（Chevening Scholarship）支持，计划9月20号前往萨塞克斯大学（University of

Wang’s brother also called the government hotline \"12389\" (for reporting disciplinary violations of the police), and reported the irregularities of the public security organs in not notifying the family members of the person concerned.\n\nIn the afternoon of September 30, Wang Jianbing's family called the Complaints and Proposals Offices of the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau, at that time requesting only a formal written notice of Wang’s detention. The head of that office, surnamed Liang, replied, “The section responsible for Wang Jianbing’s case is the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau,  it isn’t convenient for us to tell you the suspected crime and the specific coercive measures taken.” He also repeatedly stressed: \"The case is still being processed. Don’t go inquiring everywhere on your own. In some special cases the family is not immediately notified.\" In the face of all the excuses and illegal actions of the police at all levels, Wang Jianbing's brother went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to file a complaint, asking it to monitor the violations by the police. However, the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate responded, “Because it is impossible to determine the specifics of the case, the procuratorate cannot intervene to monitor.\"\n\nOver many days, Wang Jianbing's brother have gone to every department level of the public prosecutor and law enforcement in the region, but the family continue to have no way to knowing what crime Wang Jianbing is suspected of committing. Furthermore, the evening of September 30, they received a call from the police station in Chigang, Haizhu District, asking them to go to the police station for questioning. Wang’s brother was questioned for more than half an hour. The state security guards clearly informed the family that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but could not provide the family with any written notification, nor could they inform them of the charges or where they were currently being held. At the same time, the family was asked not to go to any more departments at any level to inquire about Wang Jianbing and to remain silent about the arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, in the afternoon of September 29, the family went to Wang Jianbing's rental apartment to check and found that the door had been replaced with a lock and the camera in front of the door had been removed. The surrounding neighbors, suspected to have been warned by the police, were tight-lipped about Wang Jianbing's situation.\n\nHalf a month has passed since the two were taken away by the police, and the family has been running around for days, but they have been unable to learn any other information except that they \"were detained by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau.\" Apparently, it is hard to imagine that the Guangzhou police will handle the case of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing legally and fairly.\n\n## [Wang and Huang’s bios]\n\nWang Jianbing (Pancake).

The South China Morning Post could not verify the document.\n\nThe detention of the pair follows that of University of Hong Kong doctoral candidate and labour researcher Fang Ran, who was taken by national security agents in his hometown of Nanning in southern Guangxi province in August.\n\nHuang, 33, is one of the most well-known #MeToo activists in China and an award-winning journalist, while Wang, 38, has worked in rural education and campaigns for the welfare of workers with occupational diseases.\n\nFriends and family lost touch with the pair on September 19, a day before they were due to leave for Hong Kong, where Huang would travel onwards to Britain for a master’s programme at the University of Sussex on a Chevening scholarship.\n\nLi Xuewen, a dissident writer based in the central city of Wuhan and a friend of Wang, said he was surprised to hear about the detention. He said Wang, a long-time NGO worker, was a compassionate person and tried to keep a low profile.\n\n> \"[Wang’s] family can’t even find him or receive any news about him. The authorities are behaving like bullies\"  \n> By: Li Xuewen, dissident writer, Wuhan\n\nWhen Li was himself detained in 2017 for hosting a memorial in honour of pro-democracy activist Liu Xiaobo who died in July that year, Wang supported him and wrote an article calling for his release, according to Li.\n\n“I never expected him to be detained, and his family can’t even find him or receive any news about him.

哪有记者不发声？\n\n文/黃雪琴\n\n媒体记者，服务于被统治者，而非统治者——The Post\n\n<!--more-->\n\n日前，我的朋友，我的同行，《新生代》的编辑危志立被消失了。他的妻子，中国“女权五姐妹”之一的郑楚然与律师从广州寻到深圳，从各级警察局问到信访办，都“查无此人”。留在郑楚然脑子里的仍是20日凌晨一点警察围进他们家里的情景，“他被带上手铐，警察留下一句‘他被洗脑了，扰乱公共秩序’，内衣内裤都不让他收拾，就抓走了。”至于通知书、拘留证据什么都没有。\n\n当日被抓的还有《新生代》的另一个编辑柯成冰，更早在1月份，主编杨郑君已经被以“寻衅滋事”罪名抓捕。抓记者，灭声音，警方已经相当娴熟。然而，记者编辑们具体做了什么事情，什么时候、在哪里、如何扰乱了秩序了公共秩序？都语焉不详。\n\n自媒体《新生代》长期关注中国内地劳工权益问题，近年来特别聚焦湖南尘肺病工人维权行动。作为该媒体的记者编辑，危志立、柯成冰等人的职责自然是跟踪报道尘肺病人工作、生活状况，深挖他们为何得了尘肺病，为何得不到应有的赔偿？\n\n研究劳工情况多年，危志立等看到了制度性的不公不义。他们眼看着不公不义继续恶性，走进劳工底层生活，用自己的行动去记录尘肺工人难以发出的声音，去帮助弱势群体争取公平与正义。撰文发声，是记者编辑的本职工作，何来寻衅滋事？对尘肺工友怀着善良之心，助其维权就是被洗了脑？难道说，只扫自家门前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜，事不关己高高挂起，在他人的兵荒马乱中岁月静好，才是正常的？帮助他们追讨用生命换来的赔偿，何错之有？他们，扰乱了什么公共秩序？哪有媒体记者不发声？\n\n要知道，自由、平等这些内容也被纳入了社会主义核心价值观中。言论自由是宪法赋予每一位公民的基本权利。发声，不是记者编辑的特有的权利，而是每一位公民应该共享的权利。\n\n自由发声，自由监督党、政府、大财团，是让人们看到制度上的不公不义，唤醒公民权利意识，并让大家觉醒，意识到这种制度上的不公不义长远来看最后会损害到我们每一个人的尊严和利益。\n\n媒体记者，服务于被统治者，而非统治者，天然背负着监督权力之使命。我们观察、记录现实，揭恶扬善，针砭时事，为无声者发声，助无力者前行。这其实不仅是记者本职，也应该是我们作为一个公民应有之觉悟。我知道，呼吁别人都站出来声讨不公不义也不公平，一是信息无法畅通传播，让大家了解多方信息以作出独立判断；二是人都有恐惧、自保之心，在毫无管控张牙舞爪的公权力下，或主动或被动地置身事外。然而，消声沉默，也是纵容。即便是服务于专制政权的警察们，或许只是在完成自己的份内工作，可是对着没有武器没有权力的记者动手动粗动暴，抓捕关押，忽视更高阶的正义，其实是一种对恶的助威和助长，终将是错的，不公义的。\n\n因为揭露权力的不公，资本的不义，因为记录并协助尘肺工人维权，因为发声而被问罪，不仅与社会主义价值观不符，还一步倒回去革命前。对媒体的高压管控与无休无止的禁令已经让真正有理想有操守的记者严重流失，濒临灭绝。2017年的《新媒体环境下中国调查记者行业生态变化报告》显示传统媒体调查记者从业人数下降幅度高达58%，全国调查记者不足200人。而洗一洗稿，舔一舔“人血馒头”，叛卖一些各种情绪的媒体则风生水起。当专制政权自以为掌握了喉舌和话语权的时候，公信力却如雪般崩塌，群众相信谣言，焦虑、气愤等情绪轻易能被点燃，人们也不再相信政府公告、报告。\n\n学者纷纷被下课，记者渐渐被消声，行动者一批批被抓，如此以往，专制政权很快会失去民心，失去了执政的正当性。当人们不再自愿服从、配合，并且有了不配合的觉醒和制衡力量，那么政权就会失去权力。但基于权力的惯性，政权有一个拼命挣扎和本能自救的阶段，这个阶段里会调动一切统治资源，使用各种统治工具，或会走向两个极端，加速毁灭或延迟寿命。专制统治难以再续。\n\n不管怎样的情况下，我们都应该抵抗媒体没落，保护言论自由。最好的抵抗和保护方式只有持续发声。既然有党管的媒体姓党，那就应该允许民间的媒体发出民间的声音。尊重并珍惜新闻自由，保障自由发声权利和渠道，重建媒体记者的信仰与信任，在当下无比珍贵和重要。\n\n即便如今乱象丛生，惊若寒蝉，我们仍看到这些年轻媒体人坚守自己的原则，勇于为不公不义发声，用实际行动与不公不义斗争，即便为此陷入铁窗之苦，承担所谓“寻衅滋事”、“扰乱秩序”罪名。人们最后会看到，他们持续发声，所作所为不为个人利益，而为阻止这个社会坏得太快烂得太透，也为更接近一点那个自由、平等的未来世界。如近日被下课的许章润教授所言，个人志向无涉公共情怀，亦无家国之思，终究苍白。做记者，哪有不发声？\n\n[原文链接](https://matters.news/@sophia/%E5%93%AA%E6%9C%89%E8%AE%B0%E8%80%85%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%91%E5%A3%B0-zdpuAyMQzhhdEq8oVr5biPmfoMET8iPF3JBEryi1muWXmKH2A)\n","source":"_posts/jizhefasheng.md","raw":"---\nlayout:

雪饼被抓30天事件梳理 ([图片版](https://i.imgur.com/eYMdtDm.png))\n\n* 【9月19日】强迫失联\n\n下午3点前后，广州警方于王建兵出租屋中（位于广州海珠区新港西路）强行将王建兵和即将出国留学的黄雪琴一同抓走，并查抄了两人的私人财物。\n\n* 【9月20日】老家维稳\n\n广州警察联同当地警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，禁止家属向外求助。但并未出示任何合法手续、未告知因何事、遭到何种强制措施。\n\n* 【9月20日】强行搜屋\n\n下午5点，王建兵的朋友位于黄埔长洲用于储物的出租屋遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品。\n\n* 【9月28日】警：无可奉告\n\n王建兵家属奔走于广州各级公安部门，仅在海珠区新港派出所获知“黄雪琴和王建兵被广东公安抓捕”，并在公安系统中查到了采集两人信息的记录，该记录显示王建兵于9月26日进行了一次核酸检测。但新港派出所警方拒绝告知办案单位、具体强制措施、羁押地点等信息。\n\n* 【9月28日～30日】家属投诉无门\n\n王建兵家属分别向广州市海珠区公安分局信访办、广州市公安局信访处、广东省公安厅信访室提交信访登记表，要求相关公安部门依法依规书面通知王建兵涉嫌罪名及被采取强制措施的情况。并向公安机关和民警违纪违法举报电话“12389”进行投诉，检举公安机关违规不通知当事人家属的行为。（但家属至今没有收到任何任何一级部门的反馈，各级公安部门的信访工作形同虚设）\n\n9月30日下午，王建兵家属前往广州市检察院，投诉各级警方的种种推诿和非法作为，要求市检察院监督警方的违法违规行为，但广州市检察院却表示：“现在没法确定案件具体情况，没法介入监督”。\n\n* 【9月30日】家属被约谈\n\n傍晚，王建兵家属被广州警方约谈。三名不明身份人员（疑为广州市市公安局国保）在未出示工作证件和法律手续的情况下，对其进行了半小时以上的约谈。国保明确告知“王建兵是广州市公安局抓的，但是不能向家属提供任何书面通知书，也不能告知罪名和目前被关押在何处”。同时，要求家属不要再到各级部门查问王建兵的情况，要对事件保持沉默。\n\n* 【9月19日至10月18日】警方传唤、恐吓雪饼朋友\n\n期间，超过20位被认为与“雪饼”两人相关的朋友陆续遭到广州警方（跨地区）传唤，警察没有出示任何合法手续即对ta们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求ta们指认王建兵（煎饼）家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片（来自于周边摄像头）。种种行迹表明，警方正在用此方式来强行罗织笔录，以便将莫须有的罪名强加到两人身上。\n\n---\n\n从当前的状况不难看出，警方抓人的手段一直在升级，越来越明目张胆地知法犯法、公然打压为社会贡献的公益人士。几年前，家属至少还能收到一纸通知书，现在，“雪饼”消失在警方手里，家属在过去一个月里投诉无门。而不断有青年朋友遭到警察的骚扰、非法传唤，这不仅是试图捏造“雪饼”的莫须有罪名，也是赤裸裸地制造白色恐惧气氛，打压每一位为社会公义发声的行动者。\n\n*作为“雪饼”的亲友，我们迫切需要更广泛的对黄雪琴与王建兵的关注！*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eYMdtDm.png)\n\n## “雪饼”简介\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人，独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持。王也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人，独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改指定居所监视居住至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n","source":"_posts/30day.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【“雪饼”被抓30天时序】家属无通知，朋友被传唤，警察搞黑箱！\ndate: 2021-10-19T02:32:53.905Z\ncover:

Box\"","date":"2021-10-21T02:24:09.311Z","_content":"It has been 30 days since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were secretly arrested by the Guangzhou police, but neither family nor friends have received information about them. As their friends, we can only speak out for them online. We hope to inform everyone who cares about these two individuals, about Chinese society and about human rights, that they are probably being held under 24-hour surveillance in secret, solitary confinement, and subject to interrogation under torture.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWe don't have details about what they have suffered over the past 30 days, only that the operations of police continue to be a black box, that the families' efforts have been consistently futile, and that their friends continue to be summoned for interrogation by the police.\n\n## The Arrest of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing: The Past 30 Days\n \n- [September 19] Forcibly Disappeared\n\nAround 3:00 p.m., Guangzhou police forcibly arrested Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin, who was about leave to study for a master’s degree in the UK. They were together in his rented apartment (located on Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou). Their personal belongings were seized.\n\n- [September 20] “Stability Maintenance” in Wang’s Hometown\n\nGuangzhou police, together with local police, went to Wang Jianbing’s family home for “stability maintenance”—a reference to measures used prevent action that officials consider to be politically sensitive. The authorities forbade Wang's family from seeking help from others. However, they did not provide any formal legal justifications. The authorities also failed to provide information about the circumstances leading to Wang’s arrest or the coercive measures Wang was subjected to.\n\n- [September 20] Friend’s Home Searched by Authorities\n\nAt 5:00 p.m., police broke into the rented apartment of Wang Jianbing's friend on Changzhou Island in Huangpu District (in Guangzhou). The apartment, which was used for storage, was forcibly searched by police, who broke the lock and took away a large number of items.\n\n- [September 28] Police: No Comment\n\nWang Jianbing's family inquired at Guangzhou public security departments at all levels. Only at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District were they informed that \"Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong public security.” Also, in the public security database, they discovered records for the two, including a COVID-19 test for Wang Jianbing from September 26. However, authorities at the Xingang police station refused to tell  the family which department was responsible for handling the case, what specific coercive measures had been taken, where Wang was detained, and other information.\n\n- [September 28-30] Families Submit Complaints About Lack of Access\n\nWang Jianbing's family submitted formal complaints to the respective Offices for Complaints and Proposals (xinfang) at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. They requested that, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, the public security departments notify Wang Jianbing in writing of the charges against him and the coercive measures taken. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a hotline for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violations committed by the public security authorities in not notifying the family members about the status of the person in custody. (The family has not yet received any feedback from any level; the work of Offices for Complaints and Proposals for public security departments at all levels seems to be essentially a sham.)\n\nIn the afternoon of September 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and their illegal actions at all levels, and asked the city procuratorate to monitor and intervene in the illegal actions of the police, but the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate told them: \"We can't determine the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\"\n\n- [September 30] Family Members Questioned\n\nIn the evening of September 30, Wang Jianbing's family was questioned by the Guangzhou police. Three unidentified people (suspected to be from the State Security division of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau) interrogated Wang Jianbing's family for more than half an hour without showing official authorization or providing legal justification. The suspected State Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could not provide any written notification to the family, nor could they tell us the charges or where they were currently being held.\" At the same time, the family was told to stop asking questions about Wang Jianbing at all levels and to remain silent about the incident.\n\n- [September 19 to October 18] Police Summon, Intimidate Friends\n\nDuring this period, more than 20 people believed to be friends of Huang and Wang were summoned by the Guangzhou police across the local area. They were interrogated and intimidated by police for 24 hours without any legal formalities, and some were brought in for questioning multiple times. The police asked them to provide details about gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home, and to identify participants from photos taken by nearby surveillance cameras. All signs indicate that the police are using these methods to compile a statement that will be used to impose trumped-up charges on Huang and Wang.\n\nIt is apparent from the current situation that the police have been escalating their methods of detention. They are increasingly blatant about breaking the law and openly suppressing people of social conscience making contributions to society. As recently as a few years ago, the family of the detained would at least receive official notice that their loved one was in custody. With the disappearance of Huang and Wang, their families have not received any notification regarding the status or condition of the detained, and have been unable to file effective complaints for more information for an entire month. \n\nThis is not only an attempt to fabricate trumped-up charges against Huang and Wang, but also a naked attempt to create a climate of fear and suppress every activist who speaks out for social justice.\n\nAs the friends and family of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, we will maintain a close watch over their situation!\n\n## About Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\nWang Jianbing (known to friends as “Pancake”—a Chinese homophone for Jianbing; born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master's degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master's degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n","source":"_posts/30day-en.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing Arrested 30 Days】Families Remain in Dark,\n  Friends Summoned, Police a “Black Box\"\ndate: 2021-10-21T10:24:09.311Z\ncategories:\n  - 案件通报\ntags:\n  - English\n---\nIt has been 30 days since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were secretly arrested by the Guangzhou police, but neither family nor friends have received information about them.

The suspected State Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could not provide any written notification to the family, nor could they tell us the charges or where they were currently being held.\" At the same time, the family was told to stop asking questions about Wang Jianbing at all levels and to remain silent about the incident.\n\n- [September 19 to October 18] Police Summon, Intimidate Friends\n\nDuring this period, more than 20 people believed to be friends of Huang and Wang were summoned by the Guangzhou police across the local area. They were interrogated and intimidated by police for 24 hours without any legal formalities, and some were brought in for questioning multiple times. The police asked them to provide details about gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home, and to identify participants from photos taken by nearby surveillance cameras. All signs indicate that the police are using these methods to compile a statement that will be used to impose trumped-up charges on Huang and Wang.\n\nIt is apparent from the current situation that the police have been escalating their methods of detention. They are increasingly blatant about breaking the law and openly suppressing people of social conscience making contributions to society. As recently as a few years ago, the family of the detained would at least receive official notice that their loved one was in custody. With the disappearance of Huang and Wang, their families have not received any notification regarding the status or condition of the detained, and have been unable to file effective complaints for more information for an entire month. \n\nThis is not only an attempt to fabricate trumped-up charges against Huang and Wang, but also a naked attempt to create a climate of fear and suppress every activist who speaks out for social justice.\n\nAs the friends and family of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, we will maintain a close watch over their situation!\n\n## About Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\nWang Jianbing (known to friends as “Pancake”—a Chinese homophone for Jianbing; born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master's degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master's degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n","slug":"30day-en","published":1,"updated":"2021-10-21T06:32:08.237Z","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ckv0kh8w5000018k2fuzoft8w","content":"<p>It has been 30 days since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were secretly arrested by the Guangzhou police, but neither family nor friends have received information about them.

of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士，卻再次因被捕而無法成行。\n\n<!--more-->\n\n2021年9月19日，黃雪琴同廣州職業病權益倡導者王建兵突然遭到廣州警方抓捕。警方以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權罪」於王建兵住處拘捕兩人，並疑對其採取強制措施「指定居所監視居住」，主要原因或涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚會。在家屬一再要求下，警方不僅拒絕向家屬出具通知書，亦拒絕告知兩人涉嫌罪名、採取何種強制措施等。另外，警方要求家屬對該事件保持沉默，不可與外界溝通，不得接受媒體採訪。10月26日，是兩人失聯第37天，親友仍未獲知兩人關押情況（依照中國法律，在檢察機關批准逮捕或釋放之前，公安機關可以拘留公民最長37天）。\n\n2020年10月，颱風要來了。黃雪琴打算拆掉樓下的監控攝像頭，看到手機上的惡劣天氣預警，感到開心。\n\n距離取保候審已過去半年多，但她的生活沒有恢復平靜。因為參加、記錄香港反修例運動，她被關押了三個月，並且進入了一個國保（負責中國國內安全保衞的警察）定期「訪問」的名單。除了應對警察日常騷擾，處理抓捕帶來的傷害，還要想辦法舒緩給家人造成的壓力和創傷。此外，受取保規定限制，她無法公開在被指定居所監視居住期間的經歷，這對一個堅持自由發聲記者來說，帶來的剝奪感和壓迫感比常人更甚。\n\n有天黃雪琴下樓遛狗，發現樓梯口的垃圾分類站上多了個攝像頭。她走遍了小區其它20個垃圾分類站，確定只有她家樓下有。很明顯，這攝像頭是為了她而安裝的。\n\n黃雪琴決定，要趁颱風天把這個攝像頭砸掉。\n\n「砸掉」的想法鼓舞了她的朋友們，作為用報導拉開中國#metoo運動的開端的記者，黃雪琴一直堅持透過平和理性的方式來爭取社會公義：她做獨立調查報告，書寫記錄社會不公不義，給受害者鏈接資源進行維權，發起聯名訴求，公開演講和組織培訓。朋友們認為黃雪琴的做法一直都很温和，所以當她提出要砸掉攝像頭，紛紛表示支持，甚至幫她想了很多砸掉的方式。\n\n颱風天來了又走，黃雪琴最後還是選擇了一種更「雪琴」的方式來表達抗議。她在每天出門遛狗的時候去攝像頭下舉牌「非法安裝攝像頭，要求信息公開」；她唱了首《Do you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。\n\n會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。  \n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/6fa9a827d78344668925c808846dd4e8.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/810/format/jpg)\n黃雪琴在海邊。圖：作者提供\n\n## 做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」\n\n抗爭者，這並非黃雪琴原本為自己選擇的角色。她曾是國有媒體的一員，相信體制內改良，並為此積極書寫，出謀獻策。\n\n2010年，大學畢業後，黃雪琴成為中國新聞社廣東分社的記者，後又進入《新快報》、《南都週刊》等新鋭媒體做調查記者。\n\n2000年到2015年前後，中國大陸媒體經歷了輝煌而短暫的輿論監督時期。以《南方週末》、《南方都市報》為核心的南方報業媒體是推動社會改革的傳媒主力之一：2003年《南方都市報》關於「孫志剛事件」的報導參與推動政府廢除了實施多年的「收容遣送制度」；同年該報突破當局的新聞封鎖，報導了非典疫情在廣東省內蔓延的情況，促使當局放開有關疫情的相關信息。2012年，《南都週刊》的《起底王立軍》系列文章，更是對中共高級官員的政治鬥爭進行了深度曝光。\n\n黃雪琴正是抓着這段黃金時代的尾巴進入媒體行業。那時她所在的城市——廣州，有着「中國最接近公民社會」狀態的美譽。她在每週的「市長接待日」上，記錄市民對市長的直接質問。時任廣州市長萬慶良因為一句「在珠江帝景租房子，每月交租600元」的言論，被媒體批評，一市之長淪為坊間笑談。彼時的黃雪琴認為，做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」。\n\n黃雪琴開始用手中的筆揭露社會的黑暗面，期待用報導推動社會改變。她寫的關於越南乳豬走私的調查報導，導致該地檢疫局兩名官員下台；關於深圳自閉症兒童的文章，引來相關人士對該民間機構的支持…… 那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。\n\n那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。\n\n2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。\n\n黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。\n\n肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。\n\n黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/27ec32ec024b49b591199428267448db.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n\n黃雪琴曾在中央人民廣播電台中國之聲和騰訊新聞聯合出品的特別節目《聽我說》裏講述她對抗性騷擾的故事，2019年被抓之後，視頻被下架，雪琴在網絡上的痕跡都被抹去了。圖：作者提供\n\n## 原來不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查\n\n2015年8月，天津港危化品倉庫因違規放置危化品引發爆炸，最終造成165人遇難，798人受傷。遇難的人中，有99名是消防員。\n\n那時黃雪琴剛辭了職，在美國遊學半年。看到消息，又得知國內同行被攔在現場外，她決定去紐約採訪911事件中美國消防員的救援經歷和現狀，以此對照中國消防員面臨的困境。她和國內報紙的編輯討論完後，立刻定了從西雅圖到紐約的火車票。\n\n火車上，她找到相關部門的聯絡方式，一個個發郵件說明來意，然後再一個個打電話發出採訪請求。碰釘子是經常的，受訪者反覆問她：你是誰？你屬於哪個機構？你的採訪目的是什麼？為什麼過了這麼久突然對911感興趣？雪琴回答一遍，電話轉接給另一個部門，同樣的問題又問一次，如此反覆。\n\n到了紐約，預定的民宿臨時出了狀況沒有辦法繼續住，她只好拎着行李箱在市政廳、紐約警察局、消防局、咖啡店來回跑。最後，黃雪琴終於找到了受訪者，坐在星巴克一口氣把稿子寫完，已是深夜，她看到放在身邊的行李箱，這才想起來，住宿還沒有着落。\n\n《「911」14週年，三千餘救援者確診患癌》發出後，立刻登上國內各大媒體頭條，同行都祝賀她稿子「火了」，黃雪琴沒時間看那些讚美和評論，她在紐約一家洗衣店裏，研究着怎麼洗積攢了一週的髒衣服。\n\n也是這次差點露宿街頭的經歷，黃雪琴開始對做一名獨立記者有了信心：原來她不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查。\n\n之後，黃雪琴去了柬埔寨，走進地雷村，探訪曾經的埋雷和排雷戰士，了解內戰對平民百姓的傷害；她去新加坡研究垃圾分類體系，比照調查廣州的垃圾分類現狀；她跑去越南的監獄和醫院，書寫被非洲毒販騙去販毒並被判終身監禁在異國他鄉的中國女孩的故事。\n\n這些報導之外，讓黃雪琴進一步為人熟知的，是她對性暴力案件的獨立調查報導和對中國#MeToo運動的推動。\n\n## 意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\n\n2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。\n\n黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。\n\n彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。\n\n了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。\n\n於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/8542effe438540ba9c8cc58b70321caf.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n2017年，黃雪琴發起中國女記者性騷擾調查。圖：作者提供\n\n黃雪琴就這樣和羅茜茜一起掀開了中國#MeToo運動的開端——陳小武被懲治之後，有更多高校性騷擾、公益圈性騷擾、媒體界性騷擾的事件被爆出。最高峰的時候，2018年7月，一個月裏就爆出23件性騷擾指控。倖存者出來講述遭遇的性暴力和帶來的傷害，同時要求社會作出回應，督促校園/職場出台反性騷擾機制，完善國內反性騷擾法。當時，來自94家高校的8000多名學子參與給母校寫倡議信的活動，一度形成反性騷擾風潮。\n\n深圳一高校教師、黃雪琴的好友Charlotte認為，黃雪琴在中國#MeToo運動中扮演著一個非常重要的角色，「她用人人可以理解、可以與之產生共鳴的語言講述這些女性的遭遇，讓#MeToo中的每個孤獨個體相互聯結，她寫下的每個故事，都不僅是當事人的故事，也是每位女性的故事。」\n\n黃雪琴卻自嘲自己是「矮子裏面拔高個兒」。面對性騷擾，其他記者都不敢說、不願說、不想說，自己才「意外地」成為了#MeToo運動中標誌性人物之一。\n\n深度參與#MeToo運動，為倖存者鏈接律師、心理諮詢師和其他社會資源協助維權，報導監督案件進程，原本正常不過的工作，卻令黃雪琴很快被敏感化。她供職過的媒體、供稿的平台都發來消息，說「有人在查你」。黃雪琴也開始頻繁被警察約談，要求她停止性騷擾報導，停止「煽動」學生。在高校的學生透露，校領導在一次講話中，將黃雪琴定義為「校外勢力」，要求學生遠離她。\n\n官方指責她煽動學生參與行動，連結NGO；審查刪除了她大部分的文章，她的人生歷程一點點被當局抹除和改寫。現在搜索「黃雪琴」的名字，出來的是她被捕的消息，和零星的#MeToo報導，她曾經引以為傲的、帶來些許改變的那些文字，那段她最充實的時光，都被這個有效率、強大的審查機器無情地清除了。\n\n她的一位同行、一外國媒體駐中國的記者Anne說，黃雪琴推動中國高校建立反性騷擾機制方式「不是對抗性的，而是合作的方式」，告訴校方建立這個機制對他們來說有什麼好處，是想一起解決性騷擾問題。\n\n彼時高校性騷擾機制的建立還遙遙無期，但Anne說黃雪琴「總是很樂觀」。\n\n樂觀體現在生活中。雪琴有次和朋友去旅行，半路車壞了，深夜裏幾個人沒有東西吃，沒有地方住，大家都沮喪時，雪琴突然叫起來，「啊，你們看，今晚的星星好漂亮啊！」\n\n不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動\n這種樂觀延續到了警察開始騷擾她與家人之後。2019年9月本是黃雪琴赴香港大學攻讀法律碩士的時間。但在此之前，廣東國保因為她發布關於香港反修例運動的文章，關押她24小時，沒收了她的護照，阻止她留學。\n\n她不是不鬱悶，畢竟學校和獎學金也不容易申請。但她隨即又想開了，不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動。然而情況持續惡化。2019年10月17日，黃雪琴在國保的要求下去到警察局，此前他們聲稱會歸還雪琴的護照，卻沒料到，這是一次誘捕。\n\n一開始，黃雪琴被關押在看守所。起初，她把看守所的日子當作人類學的田野調查，她傾聽她們的故事，還想為她們寫書，書名都想好了，就叫《女子監獄A101》。101是她所在的監室。\n\n![9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/6e2356d20be34477a6f7480fd089ac64.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。圖：作者提供\n後來被指定居所監視居住，日子就不那麼好過了。藝術家艾未未也曾被監視居住，他做過一場展覽，還原被指定居所監視居住的生活情況。在一個無人知曉的地方，見不到律師和家屬，完全與外人斷絕接觸。在窄小的空間裏，除了不規則的審問，至少有兩個人每天24小時站在身邊，記錄下你的所有動作和表情，伸幾次懶腰，吃幾口飯，喝幾杯水，上廁所、洗澡、睡覺，天天如此。\n\n在如此沒有隱私、備受壓迫的環境下，雪琴還同情看守人員，她們在她上完廁所後，還要去確定她的大便是軟的還是硬的；她們在她睡着時，要記錄她翻身的次數。沒有人可以交談，她只能在狹小的房間裏散步，一邊讓自己的思緒飄到遠方，她試着想像，小王子後來遇到的玫瑰園中那5000朵玫瑰，每一朵都是什麼樣，和小王子鍾愛的那朵有什麼不同。\n\n這種有些浪漫樂觀的情緒，似乎在經歷過生活摧折的人身上並不多見。黃雪琴說，之所以能夠坦然地接受自己的際遇，是因為作為記者，她讀過、看過、聽過、寫過太多他人的遭遇：寧為玉碎的林昭，精神獨立的陳寅恪，那些奔向廣場又回不來的年輕人。\n\n這讓黃雪琴得到了安慰和力量。她也剖析，這也可能是一種逃避。實際上，從2018年開始，她就會時不時陷入一種「失語」狀態。某一段時間，她會什麼都不想說，什麼都無力做，被一種巨大的虛無和絕望籠罩。\n\n或許2019年是個喘息機會，入學前，黃雪琴在香港大學訪學。誰也沒料到，反修例運動就在此時爆發了。\n\n## 「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\n\n6月9日，為了反對修訂逃犯條例，100多萬香港人走上街頭，用和平遊行的方式表達反對態度。在社會運動的歷史現場，黃雪琴帶着要去「發聲、參與、見證並記錄」的心態，加入了最初的遊行。\n\n她跟着人群走，一邊在朋友圈發着現場的照片和視頻，卻發現相關內容不斷被屏蔽刪除。香港運動成為敏感度最高的話題。在大陸，一切關於反修例運動的信息都會受到審查，當局開動宣傳機器，稱抗爭者「與境外勢力勾結」，用暴力反對一國兩制，是「港獨」、「暴徒」。\n\n黃雪琴在現場看到這些官方敘事中的「暴徒」是如何有序地參與遊行，如何有禮貌地給彼此讓路，又如何使用和理非方式表達自己；也看到官方宣傳污名化、妖魔化運動後導致的輿論撕裂，她更明白真實記錄的重要。視頻照片發不出去，她就發文字「七分之一的香港人走上街頭，反對惡法」。朋友們看到了來問她「香港發生了什麼？反對什麼惡法？為什麼反對？」，她都一一耐心解釋。\n\n後來，微博、微信上關於這場抗爭的痕跡被抹去，她自己的賬號也被禁言，官方媒體只允許「暴徒亂港」一種定論，她感覺這場運動會像30年前北京天安門那場運動一樣被國家機器抹除、改寫，一種使命感和責任感湧上來，她要承擔起一位記者的責任，要記錄下歷史的碎片，要盡力還原現場真實的聲音，抱着這樣一種心情，她實名寫下了那篇《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》，正是這篇文章直接讓她陷入牢獄之災。\n\n文章發出來的第二天深夜，警察便去到她廣州的家裏找她的家人，要求黃雪琴「閉嘴」。之後，黃雪琴返回大陸家中當晚，就被抓了。\n\n按照同行Anne的話說，「除了履行作為記者的職責報導香港反送中運動之外，她什麼都沒有做」。\n\n黃雪琴考慮過後果，深思熟慮後，她認為自己做不到不去記錄，對她來說，那是記者，尤其是在場的記者的失職。正如《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》文章最後所說，「親身經歷了，見證了，就不能假裝無知，不能放棄記錄，不能坐而待斃。黑暗無邊，僅剩的一絲真實和亮光，絕對不能拱手相讓。」\n\n「一秒鐘的黑暗不會讓人成為瞎子」——在被關押的黑暗的時間中，也是這句話給了黃雪琴力量。\n\n國家暴力機關對待異見者、行動者一般是先展現「鐵拳」和暴力，然後是漫長的關押，教育，轉化。對被監禁者而言，最初的恐嚇與威脅慢慢失效，後來的敵人，變成了漫長無盡頭的時光。\n\n黃雪琴無數次地回憶曾讀過的書，去過的地方，遇到過的人，保持讓思維的運轉。面對長期的轉化教育，她把自己想像成一個女特務。女特務不像女英雄，永遠慷慨激昂，在那種環境裏，用本色去應對會很快被消耗。女特務懂得斡旋，她聰明、狡猾，在保護自己的同時，也不會忘記自己的使命。\n\n但黃雪琴又對這套「把自己想像成一個女特務」的方式非常警惕，因為這樣就達到了轉化教育的目的：讓真誠的人變得沉默、逢場作戲、表裏不一。她厭惡這種做法，她喜歡坐在草地上和身邊的人暢談。坦誠、真實，對她來說非常重要。\n\n曾經在2020年參與聲援黃雪琴的小北，初次見面便覺得她是個特別有原則的人。當時他們分組玩遊戲，規則是，如果每組都選擇同一個數字，便都可以獲得加分，如果其中一組和其它組選的不一樣，則選擇不一樣的組可以加分，其它相同選擇的組要扣分。組與組之間可以交談，以協商或欺騙的方式說服對方，最後哪個組得到最高分，哪個組獲勝。\n\n一場遊戲中的爾虞我詐開始了。有些組為了勝利而選擇拉攏、欺騙。但黃雪琴堅持認為，大家一定要共贏，建立彼此信任的夥伴關係，不能被遊戲規則操弄。小北說，雪琴當時非常激動，說到最後甚至哭了出來。\n\n對黃雪琴來說，保持敏感，保持對痛苦和憤怒的感知才能在這個荒謬時代中，做一個更好的記者。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/2ed6ce558eb848c9a4aeb0f4af6e4968.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/1467/format/jpg)\n\n2021年秋，黃雪琴獲得英國志奮領獎學金支持，原計劃於9月20日前往薩塞克斯大學（University of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士。圖：作者提供\n\n## 「哪有記者不發聲」\n\n取保候審出來後，黃雪琴有時會做噩夢。有一次她夢到自己又被關進監獄，夢裏有一位暴君，不知為何暴怒要蒸煮犯人吃，卻又覺得犯人太低賤，便煮了一個大臣，吃到手指發現還有戒指遺留在上面，暴君大怒，又要繼續吃人。雪琴在夢裏又驚又怒，要出去聲討暴君，卻被家人捂住嘴，「吃的又不是你，別瞎操心，不準喊」。雪琴驚醒了。她想起被消失的公民記者張展、陳秋實、李澤華。\n\n她不斷提醒自己，不要陷入自我感動。相比很多人，她的生活沒有被毀，她沒有遭遇身體酷刑，沒有太多的創傷，貓狗雙全，有空和朋友去喝小酒。已經是很大的幸運了。她依然願意把精力放在觀察和記錄這個荒謬時代，以及在時代中掙扎的人。\n\n當然，牢獄之災在她身上留下痕跡。警察的騷擾和監控仍在繼續，她不能離開廣州，她害怕自家小狗的叫聲，因為每次國保突然來訪，她的狗都會狂吠不止。\n\n儘管她被要求不能公開講述自己在裏面的經歷，但保釋幾個月後，黃雪琴終於可以拿起筆寫日記，並分享給少數朋友。據她的朋友透露，她日記裏清晰記錄着，國保如何刺激她，監控她，阻撓她正常工作，通過記錄，雪琴一點點找回了自己的力量。\n\n「哪有記者不發聲」，這是她寫過的文章標題。她堅持着報導和記錄，只是只能以匿名的形式發表文章。她採訪寫作的女性抗爭者李翹楚，獲得了2021年SOPA「卓越女性議題報道獎」金獎。只是沒有想到，她又一次步入了和她們類似的命運。\n\n採訪的最後，我問她，你理想中的社會是什麼樣？\n\n她說，是「群魔亂舞」的，每個人都可以自然地自由地生長，有人做妖孽，有人做鬥士，要像一個百草花園，盛開着各種各樣的花朵。\n\n我問，那你在其中的角色呢？\n\n她毫不猶豫，「我是那個記錄者，我會拿着我的筆、我的鏡頭把每一朵花如何生長、盛開、凋零都記錄下來。」然後她補充了一句，「當然，我自己也要盛開。」\n\n####

媒体报道\n---\n【編者按】：本文由端傳媒與NGOCN聲音計劃聯合出品，首發於端傳媒。\n\n黃雪琴，中國獨立調查記者，女權行動者。曾任職《新快報》、《南都週刊》等國有媒體，後辭職成為獨立記者。2018年，她深度參與推動中國#MeToo運動，支持多例個案維權，並發起一系列反性騷擾行動。2019年，她在香港參加反修例遊行並實名發表記錄文章，因此被中國當局以「尋釁滋事罪」刑事拘留，並被採取強制措施「指定地點監視居住」3個月，原定於當年9月入讀港大法學系碩士項目，也因被捕而無法前往。2020年1月17日她被取保候審。2021年秋，黃雪琴獲得英國志奮領獎學金支持，原計劃於9月20日赴薩塞克斯大學（University of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士，卻再次因被捕而無法成行。\n\n<!--more-->\n\n2021年9月19日，黃雪琴同廣州職業病權益倡導者王建兵突然遭到廣州警方抓捕。警方以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權罪」於王建兵住處拘捕兩人，並疑對其採取強制措施「指定居所監視居住」，主要原因或涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚會。在家屬一再要求下，警方不僅拒絕向家屬出具通知書，亦拒絕告知兩人涉嫌罪名、採取何種強制措施等。另外，警方要求家屬對該事件保持沉默，不可與外界溝通，不得接受媒體採訪。10月26日，是兩人失聯第37天，親友仍未獲知兩人關押情況（依照中國法律，在檢察機關批准逮捕或釋放之前，公安機關可以拘留公民最長37天）。\n\n2020年10月，颱風要來了。黃雪琴打算拆掉樓下的監控攝像頭，看到手機上的惡劣天氣預警，感到開心。\n\n距離取保候審已過去半年多，但她的生活沒有恢復平靜。因為參加、記錄香港反修例運動，她被關押了三個月，並且進入了一個國保（負責中國國內安全保衞的警察）定期「訪問」的名單。除了應對警察日常騷擾，處理抓捕帶來的傷害，還要想辦法舒緩給家人造成的壓力和創傷。此外，受取保規定限制，她無法公開在被指定居所監視居住期間的經歷，這對一個堅持自由發聲記者來說，帶來的剝奪感和壓迫感比常人更甚。\n\n有天黃雪琴下樓遛狗，發現樓梯口的垃圾分類站上多了個攝像頭。她走遍了小區其它20個垃圾分類站，確定只有她家樓下有。很明顯，這攝像頭是為了她而安裝的。\n\n黃雪琴決定，要趁颱風天把這個攝像頭砸掉。\n\n「砸掉」的想法鼓舞了她的朋友們，作為用報導拉開中國#metoo運動的開端的記者，黃雪琴一直堅持透過平和理性的方式來爭取社會公義：她做獨立調查報告，書寫記錄社會不公不義，給受害者鏈接資源進行維權，發起聯名訴求，公開演講和組織培訓。朋友們認為黃雪琴的做法一直都很温和，所以當她提出要砸掉攝像頭，紛紛表示支持，甚至幫她想了很多砸掉的方式。\n\n颱風天來了又走，黃雪琴最後還是選擇了一種更「雪琴」的方式來表達抗議。她在每天出門遛狗的時候去攝像頭下舉牌「非法安裝攝像頭，要求信息公開」；她唱了首《Do you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。\n\n會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。

做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」\n\n抗爭者，這並非黃雪琴原本為自己選擇的角色。她曾是國有媒體的一員，相信體制內改良，並為此積極書寫，出謀獻策。\n\n2010年，大學畢業後，黃雪琴成為中國新聞社廣東分社的記者，後又進入《新快報》、《南都週刊》等新鋭媒體做調查記者。\n\n2000年到2015年前後，中國大陸媒體經歷了輝煌而短暫的輿論監督時期。以《南方週末》、《南方都市報》為核心的南方報業媒體是推動社會改革的傳媒主力之一：2003年《南方都市報》關於「孫志剛事件」的報導參與推動政府廢除了實施多年的「收容遣送制度」；同年該報突破當局的新聞封鎖，報導了非典疫情在廣東省內蔓延的情況，促使當局放開有關疫情的相關信息。2012年，《南都週刊》的《起底王立軍》系列文章，更是對中共高級官員的政治鬥爭進行了深度曝光。\n\n黃雪琴正是抓着這段黃金時代的尾巴進入媒體行業。那時她所在的城市——廣州，有着「中國最接近公民社會」狀態的美譽。她在每週的「市長接待日」上，記錄市民對市長的直接質問。時任廣州市長萬慶良因為一句「在珠江帝景租房子，每月交租600元」的言論，被媒體批評，一市之長淪為坊間笑談。彼時的黃雪琴認為，做記者履行監督權，「就像呼吸一般自然」。\n\n黃雪琴開始用手中的筆揭露社會的黑暗面，期待用報導推動社會改變。她寫的關於越南乳豬走私的調查報導，導致該地檢疫局兩名官員下台；關於深圳自閉症兒童的文章，引來相關人士對該民間機構的支持…… 那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。\n\n那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。\n\n2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。\n\n黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。\n\n肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。\n\n黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/27ec32ec024b49b591199428267448db.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n\n黃雪琴曾在中央人民廣播電台中國之聲和騰訊新聞聯合出品的特別節目《聽我說》裏講述她對抗性騷擾的故事，2019年被抓之後，視頻被下架，雪琴在網絡上的痕跡都被抹去了。圖：作者提供\n\n## 原來不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查\n\n2015年8月，天津港危化品倉庫因違規放置危化品引發爆炸，最終造成165人遇難，798人受傷。遇難的人中，有99名是消防員。\n\n那時黃雪琴剛辭了職，在美國遊學半年。看到消息，又得知國內同行被攔在現場外，她決定去紐約採訪911事件中美國消防員的救援經歷和現狀，以此對照中國消防員面臨的困境。她和國內報紙的編輯討論完後，立刻定了從西雅圖到紐約的火車票。\n\n火車上，她找到相關部門的聯絡方式，一個個發郵件說明來意，然後再一個個打電話發出採訪請求。碰釘子是經常的，受訪者反覆問她：你是誰？你屬於哪個機構？你的採訪目的是什麼？為什麼過了這麼久突然對911感興趣？雪琴回答一遍，電話轉接給另一個部門，同樣的問題又問一次，如此反覆。\n\n到了紐約，預定的民宿臨時出了狀況沒有辦法繼續住，她只好拎着行李箱在市政廳、紐約警察局、消防局、咖啡店來回跑。最後，黃雪琴終於找到了受訪者，坐在星巴克一口氣把稿子寫完，已是深夜，她看到放在身邊的行李箱，這才想起來，住宿還沒有着落。\n\n《「911」14週年，三千餘救援者確診患癌》發出後，立刻登上國內各大媒體頭條，同行都祝賀她稿子「火了」，黃雪琴沒時間看那些讚美和評論，她在紐約一家洗衣店裏，研究着怎麼洗積攢了一週的髒衣服。\n\n也是這次差點露宿街頭的經歷，黃雪琴開始對做一名獨立記者有了信心：原來她不用依靠一個機構，也能做獨立調查。\n\n之後，黃雪琴去了柬埔寨，走進地雷村，探訪曾經的埋雷和排雷戰士，了解內戰對平民百姓的傷害；她去新加坡研究垃圾分類體系，比照調查廣州的垃圾分類現狀；她跑去越南的監獄和醫院，書寫被非洲毒販騙去販毒並被判終身監禁在異國他鄉的中國女孩的故事。\n\n這些報導之外，讓黃雪琴進一步為人熟知的，是她對性暴力案件的獨立調查報導和對中國#MeToo運動的推動。\n\n## 意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\n\n2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。\n\n黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。\n\n彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。\n\n了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。\n\n於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/8542effe438540ba9c8cc58b70321caf.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n2017年，黃雪琴發起中國女記者性騷擾調查。圖：作者提供\n\n黃雪琴就這樣和羅茜茜一起掀開了中國#MeToo運動的開端——陳小武被懲治之後，有更多高校性騷擾、公益圈性騷擾、媒體界性騷擾的事件被爆出。最高峰的時候，2018年7月，一個月裏就爆出23件性騷擾指控。倖存者出來講述遭遇的性暴力和帶來的傷害，同時要求社會作出回應，督促校園/職場出台反性騷擾機制，完善國內反性騷擾法。當時，來自94家高校的8000多名學子參與給母校寫倡議信的活動，一度形成反性騷擾風潮。\n\n深圳一高校教師、黃雪琴的好友Charlotte認為，黃雪琴在中國#MeToo運動中扮演著一個非常重要的角色，「她用人人可以理解、可以與之產生共鳴的語言講述這些女性的遭遇，讓#MeToo中的每個孤獨個體相互聯結，她寫下的每個故事，都不僅是當事人的故事，也是每位女性的故事。」\n\n黃雪琴卻自嘲自己是「矮子裏面拔高個兒」。面對性騷擾，其他記者都不敢說、不願說、不想說，自己才「意外地」成為了#MeToo運動中標誌性人物之一。\n\n深度參與#MeToo運動，為倖存者鏈接律師、心理諮詢師和其他社會資源協助維權，報導監督案件進程，原本正常不過的工作，卻令黃雪琴很快被敏感化。她供職過的媒體、供稿的平台都發來消息，說「有人在查你」。黃雪琴也開始頻繁被警察約談，要求她停止性騷擾報導，停止「煽動」學生。在高校的學生透露，校領導在一次講話中，將黃雪琴定義為「校外勢力」，要求學生遠離她。\n\n官方指責她煽動學生參與行動，連結NGO；審查刪除了她大部分的文章，她的人生歷程一點點被當局抹除和改寫。現在搜索「黃雪琴」的名字，出來的是她被捕的消息，和零星的#MeToo報導，她曾經引以為傲的、帶來些許改變的那些文字，那段她最充實的時光，都被這個有效率、強大的審查機器無情地清除了。\n\n她的一位同行、一外國媒體駐中國的記者Anne說，黃雪琴推動中國高校建立反性騷擾機制方式「不是對抗性的，而是合作的方式」，告訴校方建立這個機制對他們來說有什麼好處，是想一起解決性騷擾問題。\n\n彼時高校性騷擾機制的建立還遙遙無期，但Anne說黃雪琴「總是很樂觀」。\n\n樂觀體現在生活中。雪琴有次和朋友去旅行，半路車壞了，深夜裏幾個人沒有東西吃，沒有地方住，大家都沮喪時，雪琴突然叫起來，「啊，你們看，今晚的星星好漂亮啊！」\n\n不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動\n這種樂觀延續到了警察開始騷擾她與家人之後。2019年9月本是黃雪琴赴香港大學攻讀法律碩士的時間。但在此之前，廣東國保因為她發布關於香港反修例運動的文章，關押她24小時，沒收了她的護照，阻止她留學。\n\n她不是不鬱悶，畢竟學校和獎學金也不容易申請。但她隨即又想開了，不能出去讀書，就繼續做記錄和行動。然而情況持續惡化。2019年10月17日，黃雪琴在國保的要求下去到警察局，此前他們聲稱會歸還雪琴的護照，卻沒料到，這是一次誘捕。\n\n一開始，黃雪琴被關押在看守所。起初，她把看守所的日子當作人類學的田野調查，她傾聽她們的故事，還想為她們寫書，書名都想好了，就叫《女子監獄A101》。101是她所在的監室。\n\n![9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/6e2356d20be34477a6f7480fd089ac64.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/720/format/jpg)\n9月3日，雪琴在fb上貼文說「這個生日真的過得不要太快樂了！」，16天後，她失聯了。圖：作者提供\n後來被指定居所監視居住，日子就不那麼好過了。藝術家艾未未也曾被監視居住，他做過一場展覽，還原被指定居所監視居住的生活情況。在一個無人知曉的地方，見不到律師和家屬，完全與外人斷絕接觸。在窄小的空間裏，除了不規則的審問，至少有兩個人每天24小時站在身邊，記錄下你的所有動作和表情，伸幾次懶腰，吃幾口飯，喝幾杯水，上廁所、洗澡、睡覺，天天如此。\n\n在如此沒有隱私、備受壓迫的環境下，雪琴還同情看守人員，她們在她上完廁所後，還要去確定她的大便是軟的還是硬的；她們在她睡着時，要記錄她翻身的次數。沒有人可以交談，她只能在狹小的房間裏散步，一邊讓自己的思緒飄到遠方，她試着想像，小王子後來遇到的玫瑰園中那5000朵玫瑰，每一朵都是什麼樣，和小王子鍾愛的那朵有什麼不同。\n\n這種有些浪漫樂觀的情緒，似乎在經歷過生活摧折的人身上並不多見。黃雪琴說，之所以能夠坦然地接受自己的際遇，是因為作為記者，她讀過、看過、聽過、寫過太多他人的遭遇：寧為玉碎的林昭，精神獨立的陳寅恪，那些奔向廣場又回不來的年輕人。\n\n這讓黃雪琴得到了安慰和力量。她也剖析，這也可能是一種逃避。實際上，從2018年開始，她就會時不時陷入一種「失語」狀態。某一段時間，她會什麼都不想說，什麼都無力做，被一種巨大的虛無和絕望籠罩。\n\n或許2019年是個喘息機會，入學前，黃雪琴在香港大學訪學。誰也沒料到，反修例運動就在此時爆發了。\n\n## 「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\n\n6月9日，為了反對修訂逃犯條例，100多萬香港人走上街頭，用和平遊行的方式表達反對態度。在社會運動的歷史現場，黃雪琴帶着要去「發聲、參與、見證並記錄」的心態，加入了最初的遊行。\n\n她跟着人群走，一邊在朋友圈發着現場的照片和視頻，卻發現相關內容不斷被屏蔽刪除。香港運動成為敏感度最高的話題。在大陸，一切關於反修例運動的信息都會受到審查，當局開動宣傳機器，稱抗爭者「與境外勢力勾結」，用暴力反對一國兩制，是「港獨」、「暴徒」。\n\n黃雪琴在現場看到這些官方敘事中的「暴徒」是如何有序地參與遊行，如何有禮貌地給彼此讓路，又如何使用和理非方式表達自己；也看到官方宣傳污名化、妖魔化運動後導致的輿論撕裂，她更明白真實記錄的重要。視頻照片發不出去，她就發文字「七分之一的香港人走上街頭，反對惡法」。朋友們看到了來問她「香港發生了什麼？反對什麼惡法？為什麼反對？」，她都一一耐心解釋。\n\n後來，微博、微信上關於這場抗爭的痕跡被抹去，她自己的賬號也被禁言，官方媒體只允許「暴徒亂港」一種定論，她感覺這場運動會像30年前北京天安門那場運動一樣被國家機器抹除、改寫，一種使命感和責任感湧上來，她要承擔起一位記者的責任，要記錄下歷史的碎片，要盡力還原現場真實的聲音，抱着這樣一種心情，她實名寫下了那篇《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》，正是這篇文章直接讓她陷入牢獄之災。\n\n文章發出來的第二天深夜，警察便去到她廣州的家裏找她的家人，要求黃雪琴「閉嘴」。之後，黃雪琴返回大陸家中當晚，就被抓了。\n\n按照同行Anne的話說，「除了履行作為記者的職責報導香港反送中運動之外，她什麼都沒有做」。\n\n黃雪琴考慮過後果，深思熟慮後，她認為自己做不到不去記錄，對她來說，那是記者，尤其是在場的記者的失職。正如《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》文章最後所說，「親身經歷了，見證了，就不能假裝無知，不能放棄記錄，不能坐而待斃。黑暗無邊，僅剩的一絲真實和亮光，絕對不能拱手相讓。」\n\n「一秒鐘的黑暗不會讓人成為瞎子」——在被關押的黑暗的時間中，也是這句話給了黃雪琴力量。\n\n國家暴力機關對待異見者、行動者一般是先展現「鐵拳」和暴力，然後是漫長的關押，教育，轉化。對被監禁者而言，最初的恐嚇與威脅慢慢失效，後來的敵人，變成了漫長無盡頭的時光。\n\n黃雪琴無數次地回憶曾讀過的書，去過的地方，遇到過的人，保持讓思維的運轉。面對長期的轉化教育，她把自己想像成一個女特務。女特務不像女英雄，永遠慷慨激昂，在那種環境裏，用本色去應對會很快被消耗。女特務懂得斡旋，她聰明、狡猾，在保護自己的同時，也不會忘記自己的使命。\n\n但黃雪琴又對這套「把自己想像成一個女特務」的方式非常警惕，因為這樣就達到了轉化教育的目的：讓真誠的人變得沉默、逢場作戲、表裏不一。她厭惡這種做法，她喜歡坐在草地上和身邊的人暢談。坦誠、真實，對她來說非常重要。\n\n曾經在2020年參與聲援黃雪琴的小北，初次見面便覺得她是個特別有原則的人。當時他們分組玩遊戲，規則是，如果每組都選擇同一個數字，便都可以獲得加分，如果其中一組和其它組選的不一樣，則選擇不一樣的組可以加分，其它相同選擇的組要扣分。組與組之間可以交談，以協商或欺騙的方式說服對方，最後哪個組得到最高分，哪個組獲勝。\n\n一場遊戲中的爾虞我詐開始了。有些組為了勝利而選擇拉攏、欺騙。但黃雪琴堅持認為，大家一定要共贏，建立彼此信任的夥伴關係，不能被遊戲規則操弄。小北說，雪琴當時非常激動，說到最後甚至哭了出來。\n\n對黃雪琴來說，保持敏感，保持對痛苦和憤怒的感知才能在這個荒謬時代中，做一個更好的記者。\n\n![](https://d32kak7w9u5ewj.cloudfront.net/media/image/2021/10/2ed6ce558eb848c9a4aeb0f4af6e4968.jpg?imageView2/1/w/1080/h/1467/format/jpg)\n\n2021年秋，黃雪琴獲得英國志奮領獎學金支持，原計劃於9月20日前往薩塞克斯大學（University of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士。圖：作者提供\n\n## 「哪有記者不發聲」\n\n取保候審出來後，黃雪琴有時會做噩夢。有一次她夢到自己又被關進監獄，夢裏有一位暴君，不知為何暴怒要蒸煮犯人吃，卻又覺得犯人太低賤，便煮了一個大臣，吃到手指發現還有戒指遺留在上面，暴君大怒，又要繼續吃人。雪琴在夢裏又驚又怒，要出去聲討暴君，卻被家人捂住嘴，「吃的又不是你，別瞎操心，不準喊」。雪琴驚醒了。她想起被消失的公民記者張展、陳秋實、李澤華。\n\n她不斷提醒自己，不要陷入自我感動。相比很多人，她的生活沒有被毀，她沒有遭遇身體酷刑，沒有太多的創傷，貓狗雙全，有空和朋友去喝小酒。已經是很大的幸運了。她依然願意把精力放在觀察和記錄這個荒謬時代，以及在時代中掙扎的人。\n\n當然，牢獄之災在她身上留下痕跡。警察的騷擾和監控仍在繼續，她不能離開廣州，她害怕自家小狗的叫聲，因為每次國保突然來訪，她的狗都會狂吠不止。\n\n儘管她被要求不能公開講述自己在裏面的經歷，但保釋幾個月後，黃雪琴終於可以拿起筆寫日記，並分享給少數朋友。據她的朋友透露，她日記裏清晰記錄着，國保如何刺激她，監控她，阻撓她正常工作，通過記錄，雪琴一點點找回了自己的力量。\n\n「哪有記者不發聲」，這是她寫過的文章標題。她堅持着報導和記錄，只是只能以匿名的形式發表文章。她採訪寫作的女性抗爭者李翹楚，獲得了2021年SOPA「卓越女性議題報道獎」金獎。只是沒有想到，她又一次步入了和她們類似的命運。\n\n採訪的最後，我問她，你理想中的社會是什麼樣？\n\n她說，是「群魔亂舞」的，每個人都可以自然地自由地生長，有人做妖孽，有人做鬥士，要像一個百草花園，盛開着各種各樣的花朵。\n\n我問，那你在其中的角色呢？\n\n她毫不猶豫，「我是那個記錄者，我會拿着我的筆、我的鏡頭把每一朵花如何生長、盛開、凋零都記錄下來。」然後她補充了一句，「當然，我自己也要盛開。」\n\n####

of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士，卻再次因被捕而無法成行。</p>\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<p>2021年9月19日，黃雪琴同廣州職業病權益倡導者王建兵突然遭到廣州警方抓捕。警方以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權罪」於王建兵住處拘捕兩人，並疑對其採取強制措施「指定居所監視居住」，主要原因或涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚會。在家屬一再要求下，警方不僅拒絕向家屬出具通知書，亦拒絕告知兩人涉嫌罪名、採取何種強制措施等。另外，警方要求家屬對該事件保持沉默，不可與外界溝通，不得接受媒體採訪。10月26日，是兩人失聯第37天，親友仍未獲知兩人關押情況（依照中國法律，在檢察機關批准逮捕或釋放之前，公安機關可以拘留公民最長37天）。</p>\n<p>2020年10月，颱風要來了。黃雪琴打算拆掉樓下的監控攝像頭，看到手機上的惡劣天氣預警，感到開心。</p>\n<p>距離取保候審已過去半年多，但她的生活沒有恢復平靜。因為參加、記錄香港反修例運動，她被關押了三個月，並且進入了一個國保（負責中國國內安全保衞的警察）定期「訪問」的名單。除了應對警察日常騷擾，處理抓捕帶來的傷害，還要想辦法舒緩給家人造成的壓力和創傷。此外，受取保規定限制，她無法公開在被指定居所監視居住期間的經歷，這對一個堅持自由發聲記者來說，帶來的剝奪感和壓迫感比常人更甚。</p>\n<p>有天黃雪琴下樓遛狗，發現樓梯口的垃圾分類站上多了個攝像頭。她走遍了小區其它20個垃圾分類站，確定只有她家樓下有。很明顯，這攝像頭是為了她而安裝的。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴決定，要趁颱風天把這個攝像頭砸掉。</p>\n<p>「砸掉」的想法鼓舞了她的朋友們，作為用報導拉開中國#metoo運動的開端的記者，黃雪琴一直堅持透過平和理性的方式來爭取社會公義：她做獨立調查報告，書寫記錄社會不公不義，給受害者鏈接資源進行維權，發起聯名訴求，公開演講和組織培訓。朋友們認為黃雪琴的做法一直都很温和，所以當她提出要砸掉攝像頭，紛紛表示支持，甚至幫她想了很多砸掉的方式。</p>\n<p>颱風天來了又走，黃雪琴最後還是選擇了一種更「雪琴」的方式來表達抗議。她在每天出門遛狗的時候去攝像頭下舉牌「非法安裝攝像頭，要求信息公開」；她唱了首《Do you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。</p>\n<p>會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。  </p>\n<p><img

那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。</p>\n<p>那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。</p>\n<p>2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。</p>\n<p>肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。</p>\n<p><img

title=\"意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\"></a>意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一</h2><p>2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。</p>\n<p>彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。</p>\n<p>了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。</p>\n<p>於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。</p>\n<p><img

title=\"「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」\"></a>「親身經歷了，就不能假裝無知」</h2><p>6月9日，為了反對修訂逃犯條例，100多萬香港人走上街頭，用和平遊行的方式表達反對態度。在社會運動的歷史現場，黃雪琴帶着要去「發聲、參與、見證並記錄」的心態，加入了最初的遊行。</p>\n<p>她跟着人群走，一邊在朋友圈發着現場的照片和視頻，卻發現相關內容不斷被屏蔽刪除。香港運動成為敏感度最高的話題。在大陸，一切關於反修例運動的信息都會受到審查，當局開動宣傳機器，稱抗爭者「與境外勢力勾結」，用暴力反對一國兩制，是「港獨」、「暴徒」。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴在現場看到這些官方敘事中的「暴徒」是如何有序地參與遊行，如何有禮貌地給彼此讓路，又如何使用和理非方式表達自己；也看到官方宣傳污名化、妖魔化運動後導致的輿論撕裂，她更明白真實記錄的重要。視頻照片發不出去，她就發文字「七分之一的香港人走上街頭，反對惡法」。朋友們看到了來問她「香港發生了什麼？反對什麼惡法？為什麼反對？」，她都一一耐心解釋。</p>\n<p>後來，微博、微信上關於這場抗爭的痕跡被抹去，她自己的賬號也被禁言，官方媒體只允許「暴徒亂港」一種定論，她感覺這場運動會像30年前北京天安門那場運動一樣被國家機器抹除、改寫，一種使命感和責任感湧上來，她要承擔起一位記者的責任，要記錄下歷史的碎片，要盡力還原現場真實的聲音，抱着這樣一種心情，她實名寫下了那篇《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》，正是這篇文章直接讓她陷入牢獄之災。</p>\n<p>文章發出來的第二天深夜，警察便去到她廣州的家裏找她的家人，要求黃雪琴「閉嘴」。之後，黃雪琴返回大陸家中當晚，就被抓了。</p>\n<p>按照同行Anne的話說，「除了履行作為記者的職責報導香港反送中運動之外，她什麼都沒有做」。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴考慮過後果，深思熟慮後，她認為自己做不到不去記錄，對她來說，那是記者，尤其是在場的記者的失職。正如《記錄我的「反送中」大遊行》文章最後所說，「親身經歷了，見證了，就不能假裝無知，不能放棄記錄，不能坐而待斃。黑暗無邊，僅剩的一絲真實和亮光，絕對不能拱手相讓。」</p>\n<p>「一秒鐘的黑暗不會讓人成為瞎子」——在被關押的黑暗的時間中，也是這句話給了黃雪琴力量。</p>\n<p>國家暴力機關對待異見者、行動者一般是先展現「鐵拳」和暴力，然後是漫長的關押，教育，轉化。對被監禁者而言，最初的恐嚇與威脅慢慢失效，後來的敵人，變成了漫長無盡頭的時光。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴無數次地回憶曾讀過的書，去過的地方，遇到過的人，保持讓思維的運轉。面對長期的轉化教育，她把自己想像成一個女特務。女特務不像女英雄，永遠慷慨激昂，在那種環境裏，用本色去應對會很快被消耗。女特務懂得斡旋，她聰明、狡猾，在保護自己的同時，也不會忘記自己的使命。</p>\n<p>但黃雪琴又對這套「把自己想像成一個女特務」的方式非常警惕，因為這樣就達到了轉化教育的目的：讓真誠的人變得沉默、逢場作戲、表裏不一。她厭惡這種做法，她喜歡坐在草地上和身邊的人暢談。坦誠、真實，對她來說非常重要。</p>\n<p>曾經在2020年參與聲援黃雪琴的小北，初次見面便覺得她是個特別有原則的人。當時他們分組玩遊戲，規則是，如果每組都選擇同一個數字，便都可以獲得加分，如果其中一組和其它組選的不一樣，則選擇不一樣的組可以加分，其它相同選擇的組要扣分。組與組之間可以交談，以協商或欺騙的方式說服對方，最後哪個組得到最高分，哪個組獲勝。</p>\n<p>一場遊戲中的爾虞我詐開始了。有些組為了勝利而選擇拉攏、欺騙。但黃雪琴堅持認為，大家一定要共贏，建立彼此信任的夥伴關係，不能被遊戲規則操弄。小北說，雪琴當時非常激動，說到最後甚至哭了出來。</p>\n<p>對黃雪琴來說，保持敏感，保持對痛苦和憤怒的感知才能在這個荒謬時代中，做一個更好的記者。</p>\n<p><img

you hear the people sing?》，還準備去攝像頭下讀《1984》。國保再次約談時，她手抄了當時新近出台的《個人信息保護法案》給他們，要求他們提供安裝攝像頭的手續程序、購置費用等。</p>\n<p>會面第二天，黃雪琴下樓準備去給攝像頭讀首詩，一看，攝像頭已經被拆了。她在自己的社交帳號上記錄了這件事，標籤是「#抗爭有用」。  </p>\n<p><img

那時也需要與公權力博弈，與地方幹部鬥智鬥勇，想盡辦法拿料，在禁令到來前發稿——這是中國記者一直都要學習的一門功課。</p>\n<p>那段記者生涯，黃雪琴快速成長，非常快樂。她還沒有被後來經常出現的虛無感困住。至少，作為記者，她還能書寫不公，做自己想做的報導。也因此，雪琴和很多知識分子一樣，對體制的自我改良抱有信心。他們相信，通過媒體監督，知識分子建言獻策，法律人士推行法治，公民社會發展，這個體制會越來越好。他們沒想到，言論緊箍咒正在步步緊逼。</p>\n<p>2013年初，《南方週末》新年獻詞事件後，形勢急轉直下。南方系媒體被納入強力監管範圍。2016年2月，習近平視察中央電視台，明確提出「黨媒姓黨」，要求新聞報導講「導向」。此前黨報辦都市報、市場化媒體空間，逐漸不復存在。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴看着媒體的調查部紛紛被撤除或削減人手，她所在的調查部門被改名為「創新部」，人員從十幾個變成幾個，最後都離開了。體制內輿論空間越來越小，能做的報導越來越少，薪資也大不如前。</p>\n<p>肅殺環境下，2015年雪琴從報社辭職，決定做獨立記者。獨立調查報導仍有些許空間，她把略為敏感的稿子交給互聯網平台，遇到審查，平台可以推說這不是自家的記者，無法管控；作者也可以推說自己只是獨立記錄，不對機構負責。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴相信獨立記錄的重要性。她相信在歷史的縫隙中留下些獨立記錄，未來或許可以對抗國家機器的統一敘事，記錄和見證，讓個體的記憶不再被輕易抹去、改寫。</p>\n<p><img

title=\"意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一\"></a>意外成為中國#MeToo運動標誌性人物之一</h2><p>2017年10月，美國女演員艾莉莎·米蘭諾鼓勵女性在用#MeToo標籤來公開被侵犯的經歷，使人們能認識到性侵犯的普遍性，引發全球#MeToo運動。當時，在新加坡參加亞洲記者獎學金項目的黃雪琴也與眾多的記者談起性騷擾話題，得知，大部分的記者都遭遇過性騷擾，卻幾乎都保持了沉默。</p>\n<p>黃雪琴想知道，媒體行業裏性騷擾到底有多嚴重，為什麼時常為弱勢群體發聲的記者面對自身遭遇的不公卻沉默不語？於是她10月回國後立刻發起了《中國女記者職場性騷擾》調查問卷。</p>\n<p>彼時，羅茜茜剛剛實名向她的母校北京航空航天大學紀委舉報了十多年前性騷擾自己的導師陳小武，但毫無進展，一籌莫展時，看到黃雪琴發起的調查，立刻聯絡她說「我要實名舉報」。</p>\n<p>了解了羅茜茜等倖存者的故事，黃雪琴幫她們收集證據，聯繫律師，聯絡媒體進行報導。但傳統媒體紛紛表示，輿論空間受限，議題敏感，希望自媒體率先曝光，他們才能跟進報導。</p>\n<p>於是，2018年1月1日到1月4日，黃雪琴在自己的公眾號連發四篇關於「北航性騷擾事件」的調查文章，包括羅茜茜的實名舉報信、多位倖存者的講述以及圖片、音頻等證據。1月4日，她還發出了倡議北航建立校園反性騷擾機制的聯署信。這次聯署得到三千多人的參與。羅茜茜的實名舉報微博當天下午就獲得了超過三百萬的閲讀量。北航破例在假期當日回應，聲稱展開調查，並暫停了陳小武的工作。教育部也發文表示對性騷擾零容忍，並將研究出台校園反性騷擾長效機制。</p>\n<p><img

Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, informing that Wang was officially arrested on October 27 on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power.\" He is now detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. The attorney entrusted by his family has not been allowed to meet Wang so far.\n\n---\n\nPreviously, Wang Jianbing's family and the attorney entrusted kept repeatedly requesting information of the detention location and the case updates, but they got no answer from the Bureau. On October 21, the attorney and the family went to the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau again to inquire about the case. The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau admitted that they are in charge of Wang’s case, but clearly stated ‘As the case’s involving national security concerns, it’s difficult to arrange a meeting between Wang and the lawyer‘. Later on, after receiving the power of attorney and other relevant documents, the Security Bureau refused to recognize the attorney’s qualifications and denied its visit application and refused to inform the attorneys and family members of the specific circumstances of Wang’s case on the grounds that it “requires more time to verify the authenticity of the materials’. They also requested the attorney to wait for the verification notice.\n\nThe attorney has been making several attempts to call the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau to ask for replies and request a meeting with Wang Jianbing. However, the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau kept delaying the meeting arrangement and obstructing the attorney’s involvement on the grounds that ‘the materials submitted by the attorney are still being verified’.

She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master's study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  \n\nOn September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor's Office.)\n\n---\n\nIn October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. \n\nHer life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.\n\nOne day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. \n\nHuang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. \n\nThis idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.\n\nThe storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.\n\nThe next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)\n\n## Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\n\nBeing a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning. She used to be a member of state-owned media and believed in institutional reforms. She used to actively write and propose suggestions for it.\n\nIn 2010, after graduation, Xueqin became a journalist of the Guangdong department of Chinese News Service (中国新闻社). After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government's news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. \n\nHuang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.\n\nHuang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.\n\nBeing a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.\n\nIn early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident\", the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the \"Innovation Department\". The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.\n\nIn this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.\n\nHuang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.\n\nThis photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased. Photo: provided by the author.\n\n## I can do independent investigation without an institution\n\nIn August 2015, a container storage in the port of Tianjin explored due to inappropriate storage of dangerous chemical materials, which killed 165 people and injured 798 people. Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.\n\nAt that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.\n\nOn the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…\n\nFinally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.\n\nWhen the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.\n\nThis experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.\n\nLater on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.\n\nApart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.\n\n## Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\n\nIn October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.\n\nShe wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”\n\nAt the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.\n\nHuang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.\n\nTherefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.\n\nCaption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author\n\nHuang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.\n\nCharlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.\n\nHuang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.\n\nThe government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.\n\nA foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.\n\nIt was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”\n\nHer optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”\n\n## Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\n\nHer optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master's degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nOf course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.\n\nAt first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees' stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, \"Women's Prison A101\", in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.\n\nLater, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.\n\nIn such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince's beloved one.\n\nThis somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for \"independent spirit, and free thought\", as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.\n\nAll of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of \"aphasia\" from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.\n\nIt was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.\n\n## After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away \n\nOn June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.\n\nShe followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters \"collaborate with foreign forces\" and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.\n\nLater on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong' as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.\n\nLate at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.\n\nAccording to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nHuang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , 'If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.\"\n\n‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.\n\nNational bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.\n\nHuang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent'. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.\n\nHowever, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of 'imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.\n\nXiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.\n\nThis game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.\n\nFor Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.\n\n## How could a journalist keep silent\n\nAfter being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it's not you who are being eaten, please don't worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.\n\nShe kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It's already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.\n\nFor sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. \n\nAlthough she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.\n\n‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA \"Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award\". It just didn't happen to her that she would step on similar paths with those females that she reported on soon.\n\nAt the end of the interview, I asked her what her ideal society looks like. \n\nShe said that it is kind of ‘pandemonium'. Everyone could grow naturally and freely. Some people are evildoers and some are fighters. They should be like a herb garden with all kinds of flowers in full bloom.\n\nI asked, what is your role in it?\n\nShe answered without hesitation, ‘I am the recorder. I will take my pen and my lens to record how each flower grows, blooms, and withers’. Then she added to, ‘Of course I myself will bloom too’.\n\nAll interviewees are pseudonyms except for Huang Xueqin.\n\n[Chinese version](https://ngocn2.org/article/2021-10-26-huang-xue-qin/)\n\n翻译：小雷、AI、44、LK\n校对：Lee、Hua\n\n","source":"_posts/huang-xueqin-journalist.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: \"Huang Xueqin: “How Could a Journalist Keep Silent”\"\ndate: 2021-11-17T05:18:38.562Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/kRFWG9D.png\ncategories:\n  - 媒体报道\ntags:\n  - English\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EJtXf4j.png)\n\n## Background\n\nHuang Xueqin is a Chinese independent investigation journalist and a feminist activist. She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master's study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  \n\nOn September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor's Office.)\n\n---\n\nIn October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. \n\nHer life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.\n\nOne day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. \n\nHuang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. \n\nThis idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.\n\nThe storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.\n\nThe next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)\n\n## Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\n\nBeing a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning. She used to be a member of state-owned media and believed in institutional reforms. She used to actively write and propose suggestions for it.\n\nIn 2010, after graduation, Xueqin became a journalist of the Guangdong department of Chinese News Service (中国新闻社). After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government's news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. \n\nHuang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.\n\nHuang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.\n\nBeing a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.\n\nIn early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident\", the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the \"Innovation Department\". The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.\n\nIn this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.\n\nHuang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.\n\nThis photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased. Photo: provided by the author.\n\n## I can do independent investigation without an institution\n\nIn August 2015, a container storage in the port of Tianjin explored due to inappropriate storage of dangerous chemical materials, which killed 165 people and injured 798 people. Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.\n\nAt that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.\n\nOn the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…\n\nFinally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.\n\nWhen the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.\n\nThis experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.\n\nLater on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.\n\nApart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.\n\n## Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\n\nIn October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.\n\nShe wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”\n\nAt the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.\n\nHuang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.\n\nTherefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.\n\nCaption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author\n\nHuang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.\n\nCharlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.\n\nHuang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.\n\nThe government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.\n\nA foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.\n\nIt was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”\n\nHer optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”\n\n## Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\n\nHer optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master's degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nOf course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.\n\nAt first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees' stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, \"Women's Prison A101\", in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.\n\nLater, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.\n\nIn such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince's beloved one.\n\nThis somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for \"independent spirit, and free thought\", as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.\n\nAll of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of \"aphasia\" from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.\n\nIt was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.\n\n## After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away \n\nOn June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.\n\nShe followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters \"collaborate with foreign forces\" and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.\n\nHuang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.\n\nLater on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong' as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.\n\nLate at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.\n\nAccording to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.\n\nHuang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , 'If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.\"\n\n‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.\n\nNational bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.\n\nHuang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent'. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.\n\nHowever, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of 'imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.\n\nXiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.\n\nThis game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.\n\nFor Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.\n\n## How could a journalist keep silent\n\nAfter being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it's not you who are being eaten, please don't worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.\n\nShe kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It's already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.\n\nFor sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. \n\nAlthough she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.\n\n‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA \"Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award\". It just didn't happen to her that she would step on similar paths with those females that she reported on soon.\n\nAt the end of the interview, I asked her what her ideal society looks like. \n\nShe said that it is kind of ‘pandemonium'. Everyone could grow naturally and freely. Some people are evildoers and some are fighters. They should be like a herb garden with all kinds of flowers in full bloom.\n\nI asked, what is your role in it?\n\nShe answered without hesitation, ‘I am the recorder. I will take my pen and my lens to record how each flower grows, blooms, and withers’. Then she added to, ‘Of course I myself will bloom too’.\n\nAll interviewees are pseudonyms except for Huang Xueqin.\n\n[Chinese version](https://ngocn2.org/article/2021-10-26-huang-xue-qin/)\n\n翻译：小雷、AI、44、LK\n校对：Lee、Hua\n\n","slug":"huang-xueqin-journalist","published":1,"updated":"2021-11-17T13:41:24.673Z","_id":"ckw332g9t00004kk272zxdpno","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EJtXf4j.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Background\"><a href=\"#Background\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Background\"></a>Background</h2><p>Huang Xueqin is a Chinese independent investigation journalist and a feminist activist. She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master’s study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  </p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor’s Office.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. </p>\n<p>Her life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.</p>\n<p>One day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. </p>\n<p>This idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.</p>\n<p>The storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.</p>\n<p>The next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)</p>\n<h2 id=\"Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\"><a href=\"#Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\"></a>Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing</h2><p>Being a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning.

After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.</p>\n<p>Between 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government’s news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.</p>\n<p>Being a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.</p>\n<p>In early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident”, the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the “Innovation Department”. The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.</p>\n<p>In this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.</p>\n<p>This photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased.

Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.</p>\n<p>At that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.</p>\n<p>On the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…</p>\n<p>Finally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.</p>\n<p>When the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.</p>\n<p>This experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.</p>\n<p>Later on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>Apart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\"><a href=\"#Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\"></a>Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China</h2><p>In October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.</p>\n<p>She wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.</p>\n<p>Therefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Caption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Charlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.</p>\n<p>The government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.</p>\n<p>A foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>It was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”</p>\n<p>Her optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”</p>\n<h2 id=\"Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\"><a href=\"#Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\"></a>Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.</h2><p>Her optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master’s degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Of course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.</p>\n<p>At first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees’ stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, “Women’s Prison A101”, in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.</p>\n<p>Later, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.</p>\n<p>In such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince’s beloved one.</p>\n<p>This somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for “independent spirit, and free thought”, as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.</p>\n<p>All of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of “aphasia” from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.</p>\n<p>It was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\"><a href=\"#After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away\"></a>After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away</h2><p>On June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.</p>\n<p>She followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters “collaborate with foreign forces” and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.</p>\n<p>Later on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong’ as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.</p>\n<p>Late at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.</p>\n<p>According to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , ‘If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.”</p>\n<p>‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.</p>\n<p>National bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent’. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.</p>\n<p>However, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of ‘imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.</p>\n<p>Xiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.</p>\n<p>This game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.</p>\n<p>For Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\"><a href=\"#How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How could a journalist keep silent\"></a>How could a journalist keep silent</h2><p>After being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it’s not you who are being eaten, please don’t worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.</p>\n<p>She kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It’s already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.</p>\n<p>For sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. </p>\n<p>Although she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.</p>\n<p>‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA “Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award”. It just didn’t happen to her that she would step on similar paths with those females that she reported on soon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the interview, I asked her what her ideal society looks like. </p>\n<p>She said that it is kind of ‘pandemonium’. Everyone could grow naturally and freely. Some people are evildoers and some are fighters. They should be like a herb garden with all kinds of flowers in full bloom.</p>\n<p>I asked, what is your role in it?</p>\n<p>She answered without hesitation, ‘I am the recorder. I will take my pen and my lens to record how each flower grows, blooms, and withers’. Then she added to, ‘Of course I myself will bloom too’.</p>\n<p>All interviewees are pseudonyms except for Huang Xueqin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ngocn2.org/article/2021-10-26-huang-xue-qin/\">Chinese version</a></p>\n<p>翻译：小雷、AI、44、LK<br>校对：Lee、Hua</p>\n","site":{"data":{"friends":{"group1":{"title":"Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵 FB专页","description":"更新消息","items":[{"url":"https://www.facebook.com/Freexueqinjianbing"}]}},"widgets":{"welcome":{"layout":"markdown","title":"发生了什么？","content":["独立记者黄雪琴、职业病权益倡导者王建兵于9月19日下午失联，目前疑遭警方指定居所监视居住。王建兵可能被以“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”拘留，主要原因或是他在家里和朋友的聚会。希望大家持续关注两人情况。","联络：freexuebing@protonmail.com ","#### [案件通报](/categories/%E6%A1%88%E4%BB%B6%E9%80%9A%E6%8A%A5/)","#### [媒体报道](/categories/%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E6%8A%A5%E9%81%93/)","#### [雪饼的朋友心声](/categories/%E9%9B%AA%E9%A5%BC%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E5%BF%83%E5%A3%B0/)","#### [声援雪饼图宣集](/pics/)","![](https://i.imgur.com/CM7Jdlt.jpg)"]},"recent":{"layout":"recent","rss":"/sitemap.xml","limit":5}}}},"excerpt":"","more":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EJtXf4j.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Background\"><a href=\"#Background\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Background\"></a>Background</h2><p>Huang Xueqin is a Chinese independent investigation journalist and a feminist activist. She used to work for state-owned media such as News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）. After she quit from these media, she became an independent journalist. In 2018, she deeply engaged in and promoted Chinese #MeToo movement. She supported several sexual violence survivors with their legal rights and started a series of anti-sexual harassment activities. In 2019, she participated in HK’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill march and published an article on it under her real name. Because of this, she was detained by Chinese authorities for ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ and was under residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL, a UN-recoginized form of arbitrary detention) for three months before her release on bail in early 2020. Due to the detention, she was not able to purse her Master’s study in the Univeristy of Hong Kong in 2019. In Fall 2021, she was awared Chevening Scholarship and planned to study master’s degree in Gender, Violence and Conflicts at University of Sussex. However, she was not able to attend university because of the newly detention, again.  </p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (an labor advocate on occupational diseases) were arrested by Guangzhou police. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”. The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) “ on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing’s place. Despite their families’ repeated request, the police refused to provide announcement document or tell their families their related charges and coercive measures. Furthermore, the police asked their families to stay silent with this case and not to communicate with others or receive any interviews. On October 26, the 37th day of their disappearance, their families were still not aware of their situations (according to Chinese law, the police could detain Chinese citizens for no more than 37 days before they get approved to be officially arrested or released by Public Prosecutor’s Office.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In October 2020, the typhoon was coming. Howerver, she felt happy when seeing the bad weather broadcast on her phone; she decided this was the right moment to take off the CCTV under her apartment. </p>\n<p>Her life hadn’t come back to normal, even thoguh she had been released on bail for over six months. She had been detained for three months and was on a regular ‘visit’ list of a Guobao (policemen for national security). Apart from dealing with daily harassment from the police and the phycologicial harm brought by the arrest, she also had to find ways to relieve pressure and truma caused to her family. In addition, due to the restrictions of the bailout regulations, she could not disclose her experience during the period of being under RSDL. For a journalist who insisted on speaking freely, the feeling of deprivation and oppression was even greater than that of ordinary people.</p>\n<p>One day when she was walking her dog, she discovered a CCTV was newly installed on the rubbish classification station near the stair entrance of her apartment. Then she walked around 20 other rubbish classification stations in the community, finding out that it only existed in that one under her building. Evidently, this CCTV was targeting at her. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin made a decision: she would smash this CCTV on a storm day. </p>\n<p>This idea cheered her friends up. As the journalist who unveiled Chinese #MeToo movement by reports, Xueqin had been using peaceful and rational ways to strive for social justice: she did independent investigation report, wrote about social injustices, provided resources for victims to strive for their rights, started collective petitions, made public speech and organised trainings. These activities seemed mild in her friends’ eyes. Therefore, when she said that she would violently smash the CCTV, they immediately supported her idea and even help her to came up with a wide range of ways to smash it.</p>\n<p>The storm days came and left. In the end, Xueqin selected a more Xueqin-style way to protest rather the previously-planned smashing. Every day when she walked dog, she held a placard under the CCTV with a slogan: “ILLEGALLY INSTALLED CCTV, DEMAND OPEN INFORMATION”, and sang ‘Do you hear the people sing’. She even planned to read 1984 under that CCTV. When the Guobao met her again, she submitted him with a handwritten document of Personal Information Protection Law, a newly enacted law, and demanded that they should provide the governmental procedure of CCTV installing and its cost on public funds.</p>\n<p>The next day, when Xueqin was going to read a poem under the CCTV, she found out that it had been removed. Xueqin shared the stroy on her social media, with the hashta #Protestworks (#抗争有用)</p>\n<h2 id=\"Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\"><a href=\"#Being-a-journalist-to-practice-the-right-of-public-supervision-is-as-natural-as-breathing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing\"></a>Being a journalist to practice the right of public supervision is as natural as breathing</h2><p>Being a activist, was not a role that chosen by Huang Xueqin in the beginning. She used to be a member of state-owned media and believed in institutional reforms. She used to actively write and propose suggestions for it.</p>\n<p>In 2010, after graduation, Xueqin became a journalist of the Guangdong department of Chinese News Service (中国新闻社). After that, she worked as an investigation journalist for News Express(新快报) and Southern Metropolis Weekly（南都周刊）.</p>\n<p>Between 2000 and 2015, media in mainland China experienced a prominent but short period of well-functioned public opinion supervision. Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group (Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily as its two main newspapers) was one of the main media group that promoted social reform in China. In 2003, a report about ‘Sun Zhigang’ by Southern Metropolis Daily pushed the government to abolish the regulation of Custody and Repatriation. In the same year, this newspaper broke government’s news censorship and publicized the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province. It pushed the authority to disclose information related to the epidemic. In 2012, a series of investigated report about Wang Lijun, the former head of Chongqing City Police Department, published by Southern Metropolis Daily deeply exposed political struggles among higher officers in CCP. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin entered media industry in the dawn of its golden era. The city of Guangzhou she was in had a reputation of ‘the nearest city to a civil society’.  She documented citizens’ directy inquries to the mayor on weekly ‘Mayor Reception Day’. The contemporary mayor Wan Qingliang was criticised on media by his statement that ‘the monthly rent for Zhujiang Dijing is only 600 yuan’. Consequently, the mayor of the city was mocked by the public. At that time, Huang Xueqin thought that being a journalist to conduct the right of public supervision was as natural as breathing.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin started to use her writing to unveil the dark side of the society and anticipated to push forward social change by reporting. The report she wrote about smuggling of piglings from Vietnam led to the resignation of two officers of local inspection and quarantine authorities. Her report about autistic children in Shenzhen helped attract public support for related NGO. At that time, journalists also had to struggle with authorities, wrestle with local officials, endeavour to get critical sources and publish articles before the bans of censorship chasing up. These is always a must-learn lesson for Chinese journalists.</p>\n<p>Being a journalist during that period, Huang Xueqin made progress very fast, and she felt happy. She hadn’t been trapped by nihilistic feelings that she frequently encountered in later time. After all, as a journalist, she could write about inequalities and report what she was concerned about. Because of that, like many other intellectuals, Huang Xueqin was confident with institutional reform. They believed that when media conducting supervision, intellectual giving suggestions, legal experts promoting rule of law, the civil society in China will grow up, and become better and better. However, they didn’t expect that the constraints on freedom of speech was approaching soon.</p>\n<p>In early 2013, after the Southern Weekly’s ‘’New Year’s annual feature incident”, the situation was drastically getting worse. Since then, Nanfang News Group was under severe surveillance. In February 2016, Xi Jinping visited China Central Television and clearly articulated that ‘The media of the Party must serve the Party’. He required that media reports should emphasize the ‘direction’. In consequence, the space for metropolis news run by both state-own media and market-oriented media no longer existed.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed that the investigation department of the media was dismantled or reduced in number. The investigation department where she worked was renamed the “Innovation Department”. The staff changed from a dozen to a few, and they all left at the end. The space for public pressure-oriented journalism inside institutional media was reducing. Their scope of doing reports was shrinking while their salary was also lso decreasing.</p>\n<p>In this suffocating atmosphere, Xueqin quit the media institution insitutuon and decided to be an independent journalist in 2015. Perhaps there was some room for her to do independent report, she thought. One the one hand, she strategically handed over her articles with sensitive content to online platforms, which the platform could argue that the writer was not staffed and have her controlled while facing censorship. On the other hand, journalists could say that they were independent journalists who were not responsible for the platform.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin believes in the importance of independent records. She believes that in the future, these independent records hidden in history could fight against the single narrative promoted by the nation. Recording and witnessing of the state apparatus in the future, so that individual memories will no longer be easily erased and distorted.</p>\n<p>This photo was taken when Huang Xueqin was invited to have a talk in a special TV program by CCTV Chinese Voices and Tencent News: Listen to Me. She talked about her personal stories of being sexually harassed in this program. After she was detained in 2019, this video was censored. Her appearance on internet was erased.

Among those people who died from the explosion, 99 of them were fire fighters.</p>\n<p>At that time, Huang Xueqin quit from her job and was visiting while studying in the US for half a year. When hearing from this news and knowing that her colleagues were deterred from getting into the scene, she was determined to interview American fire fighters’ rescuing experiences in 911 and their current situations to compare with the difficulties that Chinese fire fighters were facing. After discussing this topic with an editor of a Chinese newspaper, she immediately decided to buy a train ticket from Seattle to New York.</p>\n<p>On the train, she found contact details of related department and sent them emails to state her purposes. After that, she called them for interviews one by one but got rejected for most of the time. Interviewees asked her again and again: who are you? Which institution you are serving for? What’s the purpose of your interview? Why are you so interested in 911 after such a long time? Xueqin answered these questions again and again, then the phone call referred to another department, and same questions being asked again…</p>\n<p>Finally, when she arrived at New York, she found out that she could not stay in her booked accommodation because of some emergencies. She had to carry her luggage while visiting City Council, New York Police Station, New York Fire Department, and cafes. At last, she found the interviewees. When she finished writing her article in Starbucks, it was late night. She stared at her luggage besides her and suddenly realized that she had nowhere to sleep.</p>\n<p>When the article ‘14 years after 911, over 3000 rescuers diagnosed with cancer’ published, it appeared on several major media’s headlines. Many colleagues congratulated Xueqin for the success of her article. However, Xueqin had no time reading those praises amd comments. Standing in a laundry shop in New York, Xueqin had to figure out how to wash her dirty clothes piled for a week.</p>\n<p>This experience gave Xueqin confidence in being an independent journalist: she can do independent investigation without an institution.</p>\n<p>Later on, Xueqin went to Cambodia and visited landmine villages. She visited those soldiers who buried and excavated landmines to understand the harm that caused on common people by civil war. She went to Singapore to study rubbish classification system and compared it with the situation of Guangzhou. She went to prisons and hospitals in Vietnam and wrote about stories of Chinese girls who were charged with life sentence in this foreign land. They were deceived by African drug dealers and involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>Apart from these reports,  Huang Xueqin was further known by Chinese society because of her independent investigations on sexual violence and promotion of Chinese #MeToo movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\"><a href=\"#Becoming-an-unexpected-MeToo-icon-in-China\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China\"></a>Becoming an unexpected #MeToo icon in China</h2><p>In October 2017, American actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to come forward with their experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag “#MeToo.” The campaign made people realize the prevelance of sexual assault, thereby igniting the #MeToo movement around the world. Huang Xueqin was in Singapore, participating in a scholarship program for Asian journalists. After speaking about sexual harassment with other journalists, she realized that the majority of them had been harassed, while all but remaining silent.</p>\n<p>She wants to understand the extent of sexual harassment in the media industry and why her fellow journalists, who often spoke up for the vulnerable, would stay silent when faced with injustices themselves. Upon returning to China later that month, she initiated a survey which later became “A Report on Workplace Sexual Harassment of Chinese Female Journalists.”</p>\n<p>At the time, Luo Xixi just found herself stonewalled after filing a report to the Commission for Discipline Inspection at her alma mater Beihang University. She alleged that her doctoral advisor Chen Xiaowu sexually harassed her more than 10 years ago [when she was a graduate student at Beihang]. Upon seeing the survey, Luo Xixi got in touch with Huang Xueqin and said she wanted to go public with her real name.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin learned about the stories of survivors like Luo Xixi. She helped them collect evidence, contact lawyers, and reach out to the press. But many traditional media outlets said that they had little room to maneuver due to the controlled press and the sensitivity of the topic, saying they could follow up only if the self media [a term often used in China to refer to independently operated accounts and platforms] broke the news first.</p>\n<p>Therefore, from January 1 to January 4 2018, Huang Xueqin took to her own WeChat blog to post four investigative stories about “sexual harassment at Beihang University,” including Luo Xixi’s signed letter of accusation, interviews with multiple survivors, and other evidence such as photos and audio recordings. On January 4, Huang posted a collective petition for Beihang to establish an anti-sexual harassment system on campus. In a break from tradition, Beihang responded during holiday, saying that an investigation was underway and that Chen Xiaowu had been suspended. The Chinese Ministry of Education also iterated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment, and promised to develop a permenant mechanism against sexual harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Caption: In 2017, Huang Xueqin initiated a survey to understand workplace harassment experienced by Chinese female journalists. / Photo provided by author</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin and Luo Xixi kickstarted the #MeToo movement in China. After Chen Xiaowu was sacked, many more cases of sexual harassment were made public, originating from the higher education, the NGO, and the media sectors. At its peak in July 2018, [the #MeToo movement in China] saw 23 sexual harassment allegations made public in a month. Survivors came forward with their experiences of sexual violence and the harm they suffered because of it. They demanded a response from the society, urged schools and workplaces to put forward anti-sexual harassment mechanisms, and urged the country to improve relevant legislations. More than 8000 students from 94 universities wrote petitioning letters to their schools, forming a trend agaisnt sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Charlotte, a friend of Huang Xueqin and a university lecturer, believes that Huang played a major role in China’s #MeToo movement. “She knows how to use a simple vocabulary to share these women’s experiences so that everyone could empathize with them, connecting the lonely figures of #MeToo with each other. Every story she writes is not just the story of the survivor, but a story of every woman,” says Charlotte. Yet Huang Xueqin believes that she stood out only because she had no competition. She “unexpectedly” became an icon of the #MeToo movement because other journalists were either too scared or unwilling to speak up about sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin was deeply involved in the #MeToo movement. She helped connect survivors with lawyers, therapists, and other resources to protect their rights. She also reported on the progress of the cases. She did nothing outside the ordinary, yet she was quickly made a sensitive figure. The media platforms she worked for or contributed to told her that “you are being investigated.” The police began questioning her frequently, demanding that she stop reporting on sexual harassment and “inciting” the students. According to some university students, their school management once referred to Huang Xueqin as part of the “foreign forces” during a speech and told students to stay away from her.</p>\n<p>The government accused her of inciting student activism and connecting with NGOs. Censors deleted most of her articles, and altered her life events one by one. Now, a search for “Huang Xueqin” would return the news of her arrest and sporadic reports of the #MeToo movement. Her articles, the ones that she was proud of and had brought about some changes, outputs of the most productive days of her life, were ruthlessly erased by the powerful censorship machine.</p>\n<p>A foreign correspondent in China named Anne called Huang’s approach for pushing for the establishment of anti-sexual harassment mechanism in Chinese universities “unconfrontational and collaborative.” What Huang did was informing the school management of the benefits of such a mechanism, in hopes of providing a solution to the problem of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>It was long before an actual mechanism could be established. But Anne said Huang was “always optimistic.”</p>\n<p>Her optimism was exemplified in her life. Once Xueqin was traveling with friends and their car broke down in the middle of the night, leaving them with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay. When everyone was upset, Xueqin exclaimed: “Wow! Look at the starry sky!”</p>\n<h2 id=\"Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\"><a href=\"#Since-I-cannot-study-in-Hong-Kong-I-should-just-continue-documenting-and-advocating\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.\"></a>Since I cannot study in Hong Kong, I should just continue documenting and advocating.</h2><p>Her optimism lasted even after her family and herself beginning to be harassed by the police. September 2019 was supposed to be the time when Huang Xueqin went to the University of Hong Kong for her master’s degree in law. However, shortly before that, she was detained for 24 hours by the Guangdong Guobao, who confiscated her passport and stopped her from studying in Hong Kong. The reason for her detention was the article she published on Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Of course, she was frustrated; after all, it takes a lot of effort to apply for graduate programs and scholarships. But she then thought better of it: since the plan to study in the University of Hong Kong had been aborted, she decided to continue with her documentation and activist advocate. However, unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate. On October 17, 2019, Huang Xueqin went to the police station at the request of the Guobao, and thought that the police would return her passport as promised. She did not expect this visit to turn into a trap.</p>\n<p>At first, Huang Xueqin was detained in the detention center. Initially, she treated her experience in the detention center as an opportunity for an anthropological field study. She listened to other detainees’ stories and tried to write a book about them, and she had even thought about the title, “Women’s Prison A101”, in which the number 101 refers to the cell she was in.</p>\n<p>Later, when she was placed under RSDL, her days started to get tough. Artist Ai Weiwei was also once under RSDL, and he actually had an exhibition to reconstruct his life under RSDL. He was in a place where no one knew him. He could not see his lawyer or his family, and was completely cut off from the outside. In addition to unexpected interrogations, there were at least two people standing around 24 hours a day in this tiny place, recording all his movements and expressions day in and day out, e.g. how many times he stretched, how much food he ate, how many glasses of water he drank, when he went to the restroom or took a shower or went to bed, and etc.</p>\n<p>In such a brutal environment where there is no privacy, Xueqin could still sympathize with the guards, who had to confirm whether her feces were soft or hard after she went to the restroom, who had to record the number of times she rolled over when she fell asleep. There was no one to talk to, and she could only pace around in her tiny room, while letting her thoughts drift far away. She tried to imagine what the 5000 roses the little prince later met looked like, and how each one of them differed from the little prince’s beloved one.</p>\n<p>This somewhat romantic and optimistic mood seems rather rare among those who have experienced the ravages of life. Huang Xueqin once said, the reason as to why she could imperturbably accept her own encounter was because, as a journalist, she had read, witnessed, heard and written about the hardship of too many others, e.g. such as Lin Zhao, who would rather sacrifice her life for truth, Chen Yinke, who called for “independent spirit, and free thought”, as well as those young people who ran to the square and never returned.</p>\n<p>All of these people have given Huang Xueqin consolation and strength. She also figured that her romantic and optimistic mentality could also be some sort of escape. In fact, she has been in a state of “aphasia” from time to time since 2018. Often for a certain period of time, she would not want to say anything, nor is she able to do anything, as if she has been engulfed in a great sense of nothingness and despair.</p>\n<p>It was possible that she could take a break in 2019. Huang Xueqin visited the University of Hong Kong before her official enrollment. No one expected that the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement would break out at this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\"><a href=\"#After-experiencing-all-of-these-I-could-not-just-turn-away\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away\"></a>After experiencing all of these I could not just turn away</h2><p>On June 9th, more than 1 million Hong Kong people paraded on the streets and carried out peaceful demonstrations to oppose the amendment to the Extradition Law Amendment Bill. In the historical scene of the social movement, Huang Xueqin joined the initial parade with the journalist mission of ’voicing, participating, witnessing and recording’.</p>\n<p>She followed along the crowd while posting live photos and videos on WeChat, but found that campaign-related content has been dismissed constantly by the system as the Hong Kong civil movement has become the most sensitive topic in mainland. In mainland China, all information about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement was censored. The authorities have launched propaganda claiming that the protesters “collaborate with foreign forces” and use violence to oppose ‘one country two systems’.  Under this official narrative framework protesters were described as ‘pro-independent rioters’ and ‘thugs’.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin witnessed  how these ‘thugs’ in the official narrative participated in the parade in an orderly manner, how they made way for each other politely, and how they expressed themselves in a sensible and peaceful way. In the meanwhile she witnessed how the official propaganda stigmatized the movement and tore down public opinions, which made her realize the importance of true records of this movement. While the video photos were not allowed to be posted, she posted the text ‘One in seven of Hong Kong people took the streets to oppose evil law’ online. And she explained patiently one by one to her friends when they asked her ‘What happened in Hong Kong? What evil laws do people oppose? Why are they opposed?’.</p>\n<p>Later on, all the records of this movement were erased on Weibo and WeChat, and Huang’s own accounts were banned as well. Official media only drew ‘rioters sabotaged Hong Kong’ as conclusion of this movement. She felt that this movement would be disappeared and rewritten by authorities just like the Tiananmen Square moment in Beijing 30 years ago. Mission and responsibility of being a journalist filling her up, she decided to record these fragments of history and tried her best to restore the real voices on the scene. With passion Huang wrote down the article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ with her real name. It was this article that directly put her in jail.</p>\n<p>Late at night the next day after the article was published, the police went to her home in Guangzhou to alert her family and asked Huang Xueqin to ‘shut up’. Later on Huang Xueqin was arrested the night when she returned home in the mainland.</p>\n<p>According to her peer Anne said Huang had done nothing but fulfilled her responsibilities as a journalist to report on the Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin considered the consequences of recording the truth. After full consideration, she thought that she could not quit recording. If she chose to quit it was the negligence of a journalist, especially for those at the spot. As said at the final part in her article ‘Recording my anti-extradition amendment parade experience’ , ‘If you have personally experienced and witnessed the truth, you cannot pretend to be ignorant, you cannot give up recording, and you cannot sit around and die. The darkness is boundless and there is only a trace of truth and light left. We could not let it go.”</p>\n<p>‘staying in darkness for one second would not make people blind’ ——it gave Huang Xueqin strength during the dark time of being incarcerated.</p>\n<p>National bureaucracy treated dissidents and activists with ‘iron fists’ and violence, followed by long-time detention, re-education and transformation. For the detainees those initial intimidation and threats slowly faded away, and later on long and endless time became the real threats.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin constantly recalled the books she had read, the places she had visited, and the people she had met, to keep her mind sober. Facing long-term transformational education, she imagined herself as a ‘female agent’. Female agents are not like heroines, who are always impassioned. The female agent is smart and cunning, knows how to mediate, holds to her own mission while protecting herself at the same time, as it is no wise to reveal true-self to battle the system.</p>\n<p>However, Huang Xueqin was also very alert of the tactics of ‘imagining herself as a female agent’. Because this is the exact goal of transformative education initiated by the authorities: to make sincere people silent, playful, and inconsistent in appearance. She hates this practice. What she likes is to sit on the grass and talk freely with people around her. Honesty and truthfulness matter to her a lot.</p>\n<p>Xiaobei, who participated in the campaign to support Huang Xueqin in 2020, felt that she was with strong principles when they first met. In an activity they played games in groups. The rule is if all groups chooses the same number, they all can get extra points. If one group chose different number with the rest of the groups, this group would get extra points while other groups lose points. Groups can talk to each other to negotiate or deceive. In the end, whichever group gets the highest score wins.</p>\n<p>This game of intrigue has begun. Some groups chose to cheat and deceive to win. However, Huang Xueqin insisted win-win principle and establish partnership with other groups with  mutual trust, avoiding being manipulated by the rules of the game. Xueqin was very excited at the time, and even cried at the end, said Xiaobei.</p>\n<p>For Huang Xueqin, staying sensitive to pain and anger makes her a better journalist in this absurd time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\"><a href=\"#How-could-a-journalist-keep-silent\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How could a journalist keep silent\"></a>How could a journalist keep silent</h2><p>After being released on bail, Huang Xueqin had nightmares once a while. Once she dreamed that she was put in prison again. There was a tyrant in her dream. For some reason this tyrant was angry and wanted to cook the prisoners to eat, but he felt prisoners was too humble, so he cooked a minister instead. When he ate the finger he found there was a ring left on it. The tyrant was furious and wanted to continue eating people. Xueqin was shocked and angry in her dream that she wanted to denounce the tyrant, but her family muffled her mouth and said ‘Since it’s not you who are being eaten, please don’t worry about it, keep silence’. Xueqin woke up from the dream and thought of those citizen journalists who were disappeared including Zhang Zhan, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.</p>\n<p>She kept reminding herself not to fall into sentiment. Compared with many people, her life was not destroyed that she has not been subjected to physical torture, nor was she traumatized. She raise healthy cats and dogs, and she gets to grab a drink with friends from time to time. It’s already a life of blessing for her. At the meanwhile she is still putting effort in observing and recording this absurd time and the people struggling in it.</p>\n<p>For sure the scourge of prison marked on her body. The harassment and surveillance by the police continued. She was not allowed to leave Guangzhou. She was afraid of the barking of her puppy, because her dog would bark every time the Guobao suddenly visited her. </p>\n<p>Although she was asked not to speak in public about her experience of being in the prison, after a few months of bailing Huang Xueqin finally wrote it down in her diary and share with a few friends. According to her friends, her diary clearly recorded how the Guobao harassed her, monitored her, and prevented her from working normally. Xueqin recovered her strength little by little by recording.</p>\n<p>‘How could a journalist keep silent?’ is the title of an article she has written. She insisted on reporting and recording, but she could only publish articles anonymously. She interviewed and wrote story of the female activist Li Qiaochu, and won the gold award of 2021 SOPA “Outstanding Female Issue Reporting Award”. It just didn’t happen to her that she would step on similar paths with those females that she reported on soon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the interview, I asked her what her ideal society looks like. </p>\n<p>She said that it is kind of ‘pandemonium’. Everyone could grow naturally and freely. Some people are evildoers and some are fighters. They should be like a herb garden with all kinds of flowers in full bloom.</p>\n<p>I asked, what is your role in it?</p>\n<p>She answered without hesitation, ‘I am the recorder. I will take my pen and my lens to record how each flower grows, blooms, and withers’. Then she added to, ‘Of course I myself will bloom too’.</p>\n<p>All interviewees are pseudonyms except for Huang Xueqin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ngocn2.org/article/2021-10-26-huang-xue-qin/\">Chinese version</a></p>\n<p>翻译：小雷、AI、44、LK<br>校对：Lee、Hua</p>\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"【案件更新】王建兵被拒绝会见和取保候审 #WangJianbing’s Application for Lawyer Visit and Bail DENIED","date":"2021-11-20T21:23:21.730Z","cover":"https://i.imgur.com/sEV3Rhc.png","_content":"由王建兵家属委托的贵州萧云阳律师日前向广州警方申请会见和取保候审；11月19日获知，办案机关均拒绝了相关申请。而家属此前亦多次尝试给关押中的建兵汇款，都显示失败。家属呼吁广州公安允许律师会见王建兵，确认他是否真的在看守所以及健康状况。\n\n<!--more-->\n\n**(Please scroll down for English version)**\n\n### 这是家属的呼吁：\n\n2021年10月16日，我们家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辨护。萧律师于10月20日到广州，21日见到了广州市公安局的办案王警官，并向办案机关递交了委托手续。2021年11月5日，我们家属收到逮捕通知书，通知书上载明：2021年10月27日，广州市检察院批准逮捕王建兵，罪名是煽动颠覆国家政权。\n\n我们不相信建兵有做违反任何国家法律法规的事情，因此要求萧律师会见王建兵并申请取保候审。2021年11月19日，萧律师告诉我们，申请已知递交办案机关，但办案机关没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\n建兵被关押两个多月了，见不到人真是心急！我们通过“粤省事”小程序给在广州市第一看守所的建兵汇款，无数次都显示“审核不通过”，现在也不知道建兵是否真的在看守所、情况怎么样、身体是否健康？真希望广州市公安局能够同意律师会见，我们家属真的很着急。\n\n王建兵家属\n\n---\n\nWang Jianbing’s lawyer Xiao Yunqiang recently filed an application to the Guangzhou Police for a lawyer visit and request Wang to be released on bail.

It will provide a comprehensive account of the secret arrest of \"Xuebing\", as well as the ongoing progress of the case. We hope that friends from civil society community, media, and international community could continue to stay tuned, and support Huang and Wang. We urge the Guangzhou police to release them unconditionally. This document will be continuously updated (by 2021.11.19).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## 发生了什么？What Happened?\n\n2021年9月19日下午，女权记者黄雪琴、职业病权益倡导者王建兵（昵称“煎饼”）于王建兵住处失联。后经确认，两人于当天下午3点左右被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动国家政权罪”抓捕，并疑对双方采取了“指定居所监视居住”（RSDL)，但警方并未给家属寄送法律规定的通知书。黄雪琴原计划于9月20日经深圳前往香港机场，飞赴英国留学，而王建兵则原计划于当天给其送行。\n\nFeminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease advocate Wang Jianbing (nicknamed \"pancake\", pronounced as \"Jianbing\" in Mandarin Chinese) were secretly taken away, last seen at Wang Jianbing's apartment, since the afternoon of September 19, 2021. It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。\n\nLatest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin's family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.\n\n此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case. It will continued to be updated. Readers could also look up the past case briefings to find out more details.\n\n- 2021.09.19 雪饼强迫失踪：下午3点前后，广州警方于王建兵住处强行将王建兵和即将出国留学的黄雪琴一同抓走，并查抄了两人的私人财物。 \n- 2021.09.19—至今，警方开始密集传唤雪饼朋友：广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，持续开始了本地或跨地区传唤或审讯，这段时间有超过40人被做笔录，且强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员包括：警方从摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员名单以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n- 2021.09.20 王建兵老家被维稳：广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。\n- 2021.09.20 朋友屋物被强行查抄：下午5点，王建兵的朋友位于黄埔长洲用于储物的出租屋遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品。\n- 2021.09 下旬，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也被警方登陆和采集证据。\n- 2021.09.28 王建兵家属广州寻人：王建兵家属奔走于广州各级公安部门，仅在海珠区新港派出所获知“黄雪琴和王建兵被广东公安抓捕”，并在公安系统中查到了采集两人信息的记录，该记录显示王建兵于9月26日进行了一次核酸检测。但新港派出所警方拒绝告知办案单位、具体强制措施、羁押地点等信息。\n- 2021.09.28-30 家属投诉相关办案部门：王建兵家属分别向广州市海珠区公安分局信访办、广州市公安局信访处、广东省公安厅信访室提交信访登记表，要求相关公安部门依法依规书面通知王建兵涉嫌罪名及被采取强制措施的情况；并向公安机关和民警违纪违法举报电话“12389”进行投诉，检举公安机关违规不通知当事人家属的行为。但家属至今没有收到上述任何任何一级部门的反馈。9月30日下午，王建兵家属前往广州市检察院投诉各级警方的种种推诿和非法作为，但广州市检察院却表示：“现在没法确定案件具体情况，没法介入监督”。\n- 2021.09.30 王建兵家属被约谈：三名不明身份人员（疑为广州市市公安局国保）在未出示工作证件和法律手续的情况下，对王建兵家属进行了半小时以上的约谈。国保明确告知“王建兵是广州市公安局抓的，但是不能向家属提供任何书面通知书，也不能告知罪名和目前被关押在何处”。同时，要求家属不要再到各级部门查问王建兵的情况，要对事件保持沉默。\n- 2021.10.20-21 律师申请会见被拒：王建兵家属随委托律师萧云阳再次来到广州。律师及家属于9月21日见到了广州市公安局的办案王警官，并向办案机关递交了委托手续。警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方，未有回复。\n- 2021.11.05 收到逮捕通知书：王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。律师表示，“将再次申请会见”。\n- 2021.11.19 再次拒绝律师会见和取保候审：在王建兵家属收到逮捕通知书后，律师应王建兵家属要求再次书面向广州市公安局申请会见和取保候审，11月19日广州市警方回函告知，拒绝律师会见申请和取保候审申请。\n- 2021.11.19 家属无法为王建兵汇款：在9月份雪饼二人被抓之后、以及11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，家属和亲友多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给两人所在看守所汇款，输入姓名和身份证后后，均提示“审核不通过”。因此即便逮捕通知书显示二人现拘于广州市第一看守所，给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\n---\n\n- 2021/09/19 Disappearance of Huang&Wang: Around 3 pm, the Guangzhou police secretly abducted Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin, who was leaving for the UK, at Wang Jianbing's apartment and seized their personal belongings.\n- 2021/09/19- present, The police started to summon Huang&Wang’s friends for interrogation. The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. \n- 2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.\" The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.\n- 2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent. The IFJ stands in solidarity with Huang, who has faced continual harassment by Chinese authorities for drawing attention to important issues in the public interest.””\n\n4. **Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中国人权捍卫者）**: China: immediately release #MeToo activist and fellow civil society advocate, 2021.09.21, https://www.nchrd.org/2021/09/china-immediately-release-metoo-activist-and-fellow-civil-society-advocate/\n\n> “A journalist and an activist have gone missing for two days from the southern provincial capital of Guangzhou. Colleagues and friends fear that local police have taken them into custody. CHRD urges Chinese authorities to investigate their whereabouts and, if they are in official custody, to release them immediately and unconditionally.”\n\n5. **The Coalition For Women in Journalism（女性新闻工作者联盟）**: China: CFWIJ is Alarmed by the Possible Detention of Sophia Huang Xueqin, 2021.09.28, https://womeninjournalism.org/cfwij-press-statements/china-cfwij-is-alarmed-by-the-possible-detention-of-sophia-huang-xueqin \n\n> “The Coalition For Women In Journalism is troubled by Sophia's disappearance. We demand Chinese authorities immediately share her whereabouts or launch an investigation into the matter. We remain worried that the authorities have intercepted Sophia and are holding her captive. The CFWIJ believes that Chinese authorities must adequately address and inform the public about Sophia's situation. We stand in solidarity with the journalist and hope for her safe return.”\n\n## 媒体报道&朋友文章 Selected Media Coverage & Friends’ Article\n\n- 黄雪琴深度访谈:“哪有记者不发声”, 端传媒 Huang Xueqin in-depth interview on Initium Media: “How Could a Journalist Keep Silent”（[中文版](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/10/27/huangxueqin-cn-duan/)、[English Ver](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/11/17/huang-xueqin-journalist/)）\n- 密歇根大学教授王政：[中秋杂感：失联的雪琴是难能可贵的佼佼者](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/09/25/gushi3/) Prof. Wang Zheng from University of Michigan：Notes on Mid-autumn Festival: Xueqin, an Excellent Activist Hard to Find\n- The Independent: [Concerns mount in China over missing MeToo and labour rights activists](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/09/25/independentnews/) \n- SCMP: [China’s missing #MeToo and labour activist pair held by police, family told](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/10/06/scmp-family/)\n\n## 请关注和声援雪饼！Please Support Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\n- 关注雪饼案进展传播平台 Follow social media on \"0919 Huang &Wang\" case: [网站 Website](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/)、[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FreeXueBing)、[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Freexueqinjianbing)\n- [雪饼案 \"0919 Huang &Wang\" Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%84%E9%9B%AA%E7%90%B4%E3%80%81%E7%8E%8B%E5%BB%BA%E5%85%B5%E8%A2%AB%E6%8D%95%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6)\n- [雪饼二人生活照片 Picture of Huang&Wang, media quotes welcome](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/self/)（页面底部）\n\n欢迎引用、采访和报道，联系请邮件：freexuebing@protonmail.com \n\nQuotes, interviewing and reporting are welcome, please email: freexuebing@protonmail.com \n\n翻译：44, LK, Christine\n\n校对：Mako\n\n\n","source":"_posts/0919_summary.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: “0919雪饼”被捕事件综述（不断更新） An Overview of  \"0919 Huang&Wang\" case, English\n  version avaiable\ndate: 2021-11-27T02:55:53.477Z\ncategories:\n  - 案件通报\n---\n本文为**“0919雪饼”被捕事件**之综述，系统性讲述“雪饼”（黄雪琴和王建兵）两人遭遇的政治打压和当下的案情进展。希望民间社群伙伴、各界媒体、和国际社群可以持续**关注、支持和声援**雪饼二人，促使中国广州警察无条件释放两人。本文档将持续更新（2021.11.27）。\n\nThis is an overview of the \"0919 Huang&Wang\" case (aka the Xuebing Case, an abbreviation of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing's first names).

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It is also suspected that the two were placed under \"Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences\" (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.\n\n此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing's residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin's journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing's Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.\n\n## 雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\n\n据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。**警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。**\n\nIt has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing's apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing's apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.\n\n据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。\n\nAccording to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing's gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn't any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of \"inciting subversion of state power\" is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.\n\n## 雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\n\n王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。\n\nWang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.\n\n黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关[文章](https://matters.news/@sophia/记录我的-反送中-大游行-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA)，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。\n\nHuang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.\n\n## 抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\n\n自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：**王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。**警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。\n\nSince Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing's apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang's apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.\n\n最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：**强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。**我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。**直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。**\n\nWhat is worse is that the police's core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang's friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these \"statements\" and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang's friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.\n\n## 家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\n\n9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。\n\nOn September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing's hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing's family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang's family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang's family went to Guangzhou again with Wang's lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang's apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.\n\n律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。\n\nRegarding Wang Jianbing's attorney: In the mid-October, Wang's family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they \"required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents\" and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang's legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that \"the case involves national security, so there'll be difficulty in meeting with Wang\". Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.\n\n## “雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\n\n最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。\n\nLatest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin's family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.\n\n此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，**但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。**雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。\n\nAfter being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated by the notice. The real location of the detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic informations, such as their health conditions.\n\n## “0919雪饼”被捕事件全时序（不断更新）Timeline of Arrest\n\n以下为“0919雪饼”被捕事件简要时间线，将会随着事件发展持续更新，若需了解细节，请详细参照各个时期的案情通报：\n\nThe followings are the main timeline of 0919 \"Xuebing\" case.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang's apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.\n- 2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang's friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. \n- Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. \n- 2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.\n- 2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing's family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline \"12389\" for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang's family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: \"We can't confirm the details of the case now, so we can't intervene to supervise.\" \n- 2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang'd family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour.

The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that \"Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.\" The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.\n- 2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that \"the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.\n- 2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an \"Notice of Arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin's family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang's, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1\". The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.\n- 2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.\n- 2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what's indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.\n\n## 国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\n\n1. **Amnesty International (国际特赦)**: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/ \n\n> Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others. Neither Huang Xueqin or Wang Jianbing have committed any internationally recognized crime. They must be released immediately.”\n\n2. **Reporters Without Borders (无国界记者)**: RSF calls for release of Chinese investigative journalist, Huang Xueqin, 2021.10.01, https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-calls-release-chinese-investigative-journalist-huang-xueqin\n\n> “Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” \n\n3. **International Federation of Journalists**: China: Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin thought detained after disappearance, 2021.09.24, https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/china-chinese-journalist-huang-xueqin-thought-detained-after-disappearance.html \n\n> “The IFJ said, “Huang’s disappearance is concerning as detainment has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to suppress political dissent. The IFJ stands in solidarity with Huang, who has faced continual harassment by Chinese authorities for drawing attention to important issues in the public interest.””\n\n4. **Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中国人权捍卫者）**: China: immediately release #MeToo activist and fellow civil society advocate, 2021.09.21, https://www.nchrd.org/2021/09/china-immediately-release-metoo-activist-and-fellow-civil-society-advocate/\n\n> “A journalist and an activist have gone missing for two days from the southern provincial capital of Guangzhou.

We demand Chinese authorities immediately share her whereabouts or launch an investigation into the matter. We remain worried that the authorities have intercepted Sophia and are holding her captive.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years.

Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.</p>\n<h2 id=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\"><a href=\"#抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\"></a>抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?</h2><p>自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：<strong>王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。</strong>警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。</p>\n<p>Since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin’s family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.</p>\n<p>此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，<strong>但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。</strong>雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。</p>\n<p>After being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center.

Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police.

The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels.

The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’.

He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice.

It was later confirmed that the two were arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at around 3 pm that day on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It is also suspected that the two were placed under “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Residences” (RSDL), but the police did not send any formal notice to their families as legally required until the end of October. Huang Xueqin was planning to travel to Hong Kong International Airport via Shenzhen on September 20, 2021 to study in the United Kingdom, and Wang Jianbing had planned to accompany Huang part of the way.</p>\n<p>此外，9月19日当天王建兵住处（中国广州市海珠区新港西路147-149号大院）被警方查抄，雪饼两人物品被警方取走，住处门锁被更换，门旁摄像头亦被拆走；警方迄今拒绝家属入屋收拾物品。9月20日下午，王建兵的朋友于黄埔区长洲岛用于储物的出租屋也遭到警方强行撬锁进入搜查，并带走大量物品和行李箱。9月底，黄雪琴家中遗留日记本亦被查抄带走，王建兵本人Facebook也发现被警方登陆。</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2021, Wang Jianbing’s residence (#147-149, Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China) was also raided by the police, and both of their belongings were seized. Moreover, the front door lock was changed, and the front door security camera was removed as well. By the time this overview is written, the police still refused to allow their families to enter the apartment to pack their belongings. At the end of September, Xueqin’s journals, which were left at her apartment, was also confiscated by the police, and Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was also found to be logged in by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\"><a href=\"#雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why-are-they-arrested\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?\"></a>雪饼是因为什么被抓？Why are they arrested?</h2><p>据多方了解，确定“雪饼”两人被抓主要原因涉及日常在王建兵家中的朋友聚会。警方获取了近40位曾参与聚会的人员照片和名单，来源为建兵住处一楼大门处的社区监控视频。<strong>警方在抓捕雪饼后，对聚会参与者多番骚扰和持续传唤，要求指认雪饼聚会中与时政相关的内容，并强迫要求参与者承认警方自行拟写的内容。</strong></p>\n<p>It has been confirmed, according to multiple sources, that the main reason for the arrest of the two has to do with the casual social gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s apartment. The police has acquired photos and a list of nearly 40 people who had participated in the gatherings from footages collected by surveillance cameras that were installed at the front door of Jianbing’s apartment building. After the arrest of Huang&amp;Wang, police also continuously harassed and summoned participants of the gatherings for interrogation, asking them to identify contents that they deemed as politically sensitive, and forcing participants to sign false confessions that were drafted and fabricated by the police themselves.</p>\n<p>据去过王建兵家中聚会的朋友反馈，因建兵生性喜喝茶，长期以来都会邀请朋友去家中喝茶聊天，聚会多聚焦分享生活日常、社群陪伴及抑郁社群支持和公益/慈善/艺术交流，极少涉及时政相关讨论。综合来看，警方试图恶意将聚会交流定性为组织“煽动颠覆国家政权”的行为。</p>\n<p>According to friends who had been to Wang Jianbing’s gatherings, Jianbing had long invited his friends to his apartment for tea and chat, since he is a huge tea lover. At the gatherings, participants mostly focused on sharing their daily lives, offering support to friends from their communities, especially to those who had been suffering from depression, exchanging views and ideas on charitable causes and arts and etc. In other words, there wasn’t any conversations about politically sensitive topics at the gatherings. In a nutshell, characterizing the gathering as an act of “inciting subversion of state power” is a deliberately malicious attempt of the Guangzhou police to frame the two as such.</p>\n<h2 id=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\"><a href=\"#雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who-is-Wang-Jianbing-and-Huang-Xueqin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?\"></a>雪饼是谁，做过什么？Who is Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin?</h2><p>王建兵（煎饼），1983年生，甘肃天水人。独立公益人，从事公益事业16年；朋友们都喜欢叫他“煎饼”。2005年大学毕业后，加入北京西部阳光农村发展基金从事农村发展工作，开启长期关注青少年教育及成长的公益职业生涯。曾担任西部阳光基金会农村教育项目主管5年。2014年加入广州恭明社会组织发展中心，作为青少年成长项目和残障社群赋能项目主管及统筹，支持和发起相关社区项目工作。2018年起开始关注职业病工人的权益倡导和服务性工作，提供必要的法律支持和社区支持。煎饼也是国内#MeToo运动中重要的支持者。</p>\n<p>Wang Jianbing (born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province; independent labor activist): He has been engaged in non-profit work for over 16 years. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation in Beijing to engage in rural development work, acting as the Project Manager of the Rural Education Program for five years. This kicked off his career as a non-profit worker with a deep commitment to youth education and development. In 2014, he joined the GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development as the Project Manager and Coordinator of their Youth Development Project as well as their Disabled Community Empowerment Project. Since 2018, he has taken on advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support. Wang was also a key supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.</p>\n<p>黄雪琴，1988年生，广东韶关人。独立记者，曾任《新快报》及《南都周刊》的调查记者，关注性别、平权、官员贪污、企业污染、弱势群体等议题，也参与多起#MeToo案件的报道和为性侵害性骚扰受害人提供帮助和支持。黄雪琴本计划于2019年赴香港大学就读法学硕士，但后因发表香港“反送中”运动相关<a href=\"https://matters.news/@sophia/%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84-%E5%8F%8D%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD-%E5%A4%A7%E6%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C-zdpuAysW5ZoQVpbPWDWDK22Dg6jF3GSGYBfx4uk3buXQSkLsA\">文章</a>，于2019年10月17日被广州警方以“寻衅滋事罪”刑事拘留，后改“指定居所监视居住”至2020年1月17日取保获释。今年秋，黄雪琴成功获得英国志奋领奖学金支持，原计划于9月20日前往萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）就读性别与发展学硕士。</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin (born in 1988 in Shaoguan Prefecture, Guangdong Province; independent journalist): She has worked as an investigative reporter for News Express (xinkuai bao) and Southern Weekly. She focused on issues such as gender, affirmative action, official corruption, pollution from businesses, and marginalized groups. She also participated in many #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment. Huang Xueqin planned to study for a master’s degree in law at the University of Hong Kong in 2019, but was criminally detained by Guangzhou police on October 17, 2019 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After spending time in enforced disapparance (“residential surveillance in a designated location”), Huang was later released on bail on January 17, 2020. She had received a Chevening Scholarship earlier this year, a full scholarship to study for a master’s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Sussex. She was planning to leave for the UK on September 20.</p>\n<h2 id=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\"><a href=\"#抓人之后，警察还在做什么？-What-Are-Police-Doing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?\"></a>抓人之后，警察还在做什么？ What Are Police Doing?</h2><p>自2021年9月19日雪饼二人被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，在广东本地及跨省地区传唤或审讯累计超过40人，这些朋友都被做了笔录，大多数都被强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。被骚扰人员的范围包括：警方从王建兵住处摄像头捕捉到的聚会人员以及与雪饼二人相关的朋友。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓。警方要求他/她们指认：<strong>王建兵家中聚会的具体情况、指认参与者的人像照片、以及雪饼二人的其他社会活动和网络关系等。</strong>警方还要求这些朋友对外表示沉默，严令要求不能透露相关案情。</p>\n<p>Since Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested on September 19, 2021, Guangzhou police linked up with many public security departments across the country, summoning and interrogating over 40 people in Guangdong local and inter-provincial areas. Friends were forcibly asked to give statements and to unlock their electronic devices for the police. Police also searched their homes and copied files on their electronic devices. Those who were harassed include: individuals whom the police had identified as participants of the social gatherings using footages collected by the surveillance cameras that were installed at Jianbing’s apartment building, and mutual friends of Wang and Huang. The police interrogated and intimated them for up to 24 hours without any legal formalities. They were asked by the police to identify the specifics of the gatherings at Wang’s apartment, match names of the participants with photos taken by the surveillance cameras, and other social activities and personal networks of Huang and Wang. The police asked the friends to be silent about the case in public and not to reveal any details of the intergoration.</p>\n<p>最为严重的是，警方当下的核心办案策略是：<strong>强迫雪饼朋友签署警方编造的虚假口供，否则将会持续骚扰和对其家庭进行施压。被强迫签名的“口供”，虚假指控雪饼二人参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。</strong>我们有理由相信在狱中的雪饼二人必然坚决否定这样的指控，所以警方才不得不转换策略——骚扰雪饼朋友迫使他们签名虚假口供，以便未来作为重要的审判证据。<strong>直到现在，广州警方仍然持续地通过骚扰、传唤的方式来获取用于指控雪饼的非法证据。</strong></p>\n<p>What is worse is that the police’s core strategy in handling the case is by forcing Huang and Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police, otherwise threatened them with continual harassment from police and pressure on their families. Some friends were forced to sign these “statements” and to falsely accuse Huang and Wang of participating in training activities that subvert state power. The police also fabricated that the gatherings at Wang Jianbing’s home were political gatherings to criticize the government. We have reason to believe that Huang and Wang have continued to deny these allegations in prison, which is why the police had no choice but to change their strategies, which is to instead harass Huang and Wang’s friends and force them to sign false statements. These false statments are believed to be key evidences in a future trial. Until now, the Guangzhou police continue to harass and summon friends as means to obtain illegal evidence to use against Huang and Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\"><a href=\"#家属和律师遭遇了什么？What-Happened-to-the-Family-and-Lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?\"></a>家属和律师遭遇了什么？What Happened to the Family and Lawyer?</h2><p>9月20日，雪饼被抓第二天，广州警察联同甘肃地方警察到王建兵老家进行维稳，威吓家属不得向外求助。9月28-30日期间，王建兵家人赴广州寻人，奔走于广州各级公安部门和广州市检察院，进行信访和投诉，均未获回复。9月30日，家属被广州警方约谈半小时，仅被告知“王建兵是被广州市公安局抓捕的”，但警方拒绝提供给家属任何通知书，亦要求家属对事件保持沉默。10月下旬，王建兵家属随律师再赴广州，家属被拒绝进入王建兵此前租住处，警方也再次约谈家属，要求其不得对外传播案件信息。</p>\n<p>On September 20, the second day after Wang and Huang were abducted by the police, Guangzhou police together with Gansu police went to Wang Jianbing’s hometown, threatening the family not to seek help about the case. Between September 28 - 30, Wang Jianbing’s family went to Guangzhou to look for him. They went to every level of the Guangzhou Security Bureau as well as to the Guangzhou Procuratorate to petition and lodge formal complaints, yet they did not receive any response. On September 30, Wang’s family member was questioned by Guangzhou police for over half an hour, and was told that Wang Jianbing was arrested by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. But police refused to provide the family with any formal notice, instead asked the family to be silent about the case. In late October, Wang’s family went to Guangzhou again with Wang’s lawyer. They were again denied access to Wang’s apartment. The police also questioned the family again, and asked them not to disseminate any information regarding the case to others.</p>\n<p>律师方面：10月中旬，王建兵家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辩护。10月21日，萧律师与广州市公安局的王警官见面，并向办案机关递交了委托手续和会见手续。随后几周的时间里，广州警方以“需要时间核实材料真实性”为由，拒绝承认律师的代理资格和会见申请，要求律师回去等核查通知。警方也暗示，“案件涉及国家安全，会见会有难度”。此后萧律师多次联系广州警方再次申请会见。11月19日，办案机关通知律师，没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。</p>\n<p>Regarding Wang Jianbing’s attorney: In the mid-October, Wang’s family appointed Guizhou attorney Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. On October 21, Attorney Xiao met with officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and submitted to the case-handling authority a application to meet with Wang Jianbing and the power of attorney. In the weeks that followed, Guangzhou police used the excuse that they “required more time to verify the authenticity of the documents” and refused to recognize the lawyer as Wang’s legal representative. His application for a lawyer visit was also denied by the police, who cited the same excuse. They requested the lawyer to return and wait for a notice. The police have also hinted that “the case involves national security, so there’ll be difficulty in meeting with Wang”. Afterwards, Attorney Xiao contacted Guangzhou police several times to apply for a meeting with Wang. On November 19, the case-handling authority notified Attorney Xiao that his request to meet with Wang was not approved, nor was his application requesting Wang to be released on bail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\"><a href=\"#“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021-11-27-Most-Recent-Updates\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates\"></a>“雪饼案”两人最新情况（截至2021.11.27) Most Recent Updates</h2><p>最新情况：11月5日，王建兵家属收到了广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，编号为“穗公捕通字[2021]X2”，通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。此前10月底，黄雪琴家属亦收到其逮捕通知书，推测其编号应为相似的“穗公捕通字[2021]X1”。此外，王建兵律师已多次申请会见和取保候审，皆被警方拒绝。</p>\n<p>Latest updates of the case: on November 5 Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice informs that Wang Jianbing was officially arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang Xueqin’s family also received a similar Notice of Arrest at the end of October. It is suspected that the serial number of the notice is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. Also, Wang Jianbing’s attorney has repeatedly requested meetings with Wang and bailing, but the police denied all requests.</p>\n<p>此外，在11月家属收到逮捕通知书后，亲友们多次尝试通过“粤省事”系统给逮捕通知书上列明的广州市第一看守所汇款，输入雪饼二人的姓名和身份证后，均提示“审核不通过”。正常情况下，广东地区被羁押者亲友可以通过“粤省事”小程序进行汇款，<strong>但给雪饼汇款异常，说明了雪饼的关押地点极有可能和逮捕书上的不一致。</strong>雪饼真实的关押地点、身体状况等基本情况，无从得知。</p>\n<p>After being informed of the arrest in November, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system of Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also subsequently failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong would be able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that the two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated by the notice.

The Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, continued to initiate local or cross-regional interrogations. During this period, over 40 people were forced to make false statements against Wang and Huang. They were also forced to unlock their electronic devices to have their electronics files copied by the police. The people who were taken in for interrogation were friends of Huang and Wang, some of which were participants of the casual social gatherings at Wang’s apartment. Their identities were obtained by the police via surveillance camera footages. The police continued to summon and interrogate, as well as force Huang&amp;Wang’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang Jianbing’s family were threatened to remain silent: the Guangzhou police went with the Gansu police (Wang Jianbing’s hometown is in Gansu province) to Wang Jianbing parents’ home, threatening his family not to seek any legal help on this case.</li>\n<li>2021/09/20 Wang’s friend’s apartment was unlawfully searched: An apartment of Wang’s friend for storage purpose, was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police. The police also confiscated a large number of files from the apartment. </li>\n<li>Late 2021/09,  Huang Xueqin’s journals were taken by the police from her apartment. Wang Jianbing’s Facebook account was forcibly logged into by the police to collect evidence. </li>\n<li>2021/09/28 Wang Jianbing’s family came to Guangzhou for him: Wang’s family went back and forth between different public security departments in Guangzhou to inquire about Wang’s whereabout. They only learned that “Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested by Guangdong police” at the Xingang police station in Haizhu District, and found a record of the two’s informations collected by the police in the public security system. The record showed that a Covid-19 test for Wang Jianbing was taken on September 26. However, the police at the Xingang Police Station refused to release informations such as the name of the case-handing department, whether any coercive measures were taken against the two, the location of the detention, or any other information.</li>\n<li>2021/09/28-30 Family lodged complaints against the department that arrested them. Wang Jianbing’s family submitted complaint forms to respective offices for Complaints and Proposals at the Haizhu District Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The family requested that, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country, the public security departments must notify them in writing of the charges against Wang and of the coercive measures taken thus far. They also filed complaints with the public security authorities and a city hotline “12389” for reporting disciplinary violations by the police. In their complaints, they reported the violation of the public security authorities for not notifying the family members about the status of Wang in their custody. To date, the family has not yet received any responses from any of the departments. On the afternoon of September 30, Wang’s family went to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate to complain about the police shirking responsibility and engaging in illegal actions at all levels. When the family asked the city procuratorate to monitor and stop the illegal actions of the police, the official replied: “We can’t confirm the details of the case now, so we can’t intervene to supervise.” </li>\n<li>2021/09/30 Wang Jianbing’s family were summoned: On the evening of September 30, Wang’d family member was interrogated by three unidentified people, who are suspected to be from the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, for over half an hour. They did not show any official documentation for provide legal justification. The suspected Public Security officials clearly told the family that “Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, but they could neither provide any written notification to the family, nor tell them what the charges are and where they were currently being held.” The family was further instructed to stop asking questions about Wang at all levels and to remain silent about the case.</li>\n<li>2021/10/20-21 Attorney request to meet with Wang was denied: Wang Jianbing’s family as well as their attorney Xiao Yunyang went to Guangzhou. The family and the attorney met with police officer Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on September 21 and submitted the Power of Attorney form to the case-handling department. The police refused to recognize the lawyer’s qualifications and meeting request on the grounds that it “needs time to verify the authenticity of the documents”, and asked the attorney to go back and wait for the verification notice. The police also hinted that “the case involves national security and it’s difficult to arrange the meeting”. Later on Attorney Xiao contacted the Guangzhou police many times and no reply was received.</li>\n<li>2021/11/05 Family got Notice of Arrest: Wang Jianbing’s family received an “Notice of Arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, numbered ‘Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X2’. The notice shows that Wang Jianbing was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on October 27. He was arrested with the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and is now being detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. In the end of October, Huang Xueqin’s family also received her Notice of Arrest. It is speculated that the serial number is similar to Wang’s, which might be ”Sui Public Security Bureau arrest notice [2021] X1”. The attorney reiterated he would request meetings again.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Attorney’s visit and bailing requests got denied again: after Wang Jianbing’s family received the Notice of Arrest, Wang’s attorney requested meeting with Wang and for him to be released on bail. The Guangzhou police denied both requests on November 19.</li>\n<li>2021/11/19 Family failed to make deposit to Wang Jianbing: Druing the period of being informed of the arrest in September and receiving notice of arrest in November, family members and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. When Huang and Wang’s names and ID numbers were entered, the system showed “verification failed” and the attempt to deposit also failed. Normally relatives and friends of detainees in Guangdong are able to deposit money through this system. Failure to do so implies that their two’s detention location might be different from what’s indicated on the notice. The real location of their detention remains unknowable, as well as other basic information, such as their health conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\"><a href=\"#国际声援（不断更新）International-Solidarity\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity\"></a>国际声援（不断更新）International Solidarity</h2><ol>\n<li><strong>Amnesty International (国际特赦)</strong>: China: #MeToo journalist and labour activist facing ‘subversion’ charge must be released, 2021.11.09, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/\">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/</a> </li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amnesty International’s China Campaigner Gwen Lee said: “The Chinese government’s disdain for human rights has once again been laid bare by these unjustifiable charges for two activists whose only so-called crime has been to peacefully advocate for the welfare of others.

它允许政府可以不经审讯把人关在“黑监狱”里。人权机构“保护卫士”（Safeguard Defenders）估计，自习近平2013年就任国家主席以来，已有约45000至55000人被指定居所监视居住，其中仅2020年就多达15000人。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Qsqqyyo.png)\n\n<center>黄雪琴，调查了最早的中国#MeToo（米兔）案件，其亲友说她现在以“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被拘留在广州。（图片来自雪饼的朋友）</center>\n\n据王建兵和黄雪琴的家人与朋友透露，两人失联之后以“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被正式逮捕。而方然至今则下落不明。\n\n很多被指定居所监视居住的人士都被指控危害国家安全。人权律师、政治异见者、上访者和宗教与少数民族权益倡导者已经成为常规的针对对象。女性与工人权利议题曾经被认为是不会超出政治红线的更安全的社会活动，但随着中国共产党转而压制任何被视为威胁稳定的公民行动，这一情况已经改变。\n\n习主席将公民社会视为挑战党的权威的“西方”势力。从2015年对人权律师和维权人士大规模的围剿开始，他通过一轮又一轮的逮捕行动，对公民社会进行了毁灭性的打击。现在，国家安全部门转向打压一个一个的行动者个体，以期引起更少的关注。\n\n“他们已经完成了对台面上高调行动者的打压，现在开始针对低调的行动者了”，Rio说。35岁的Rio是王的朋友，也是一位劳工权利倡导者，为保护其安全，他要求我们只使用其英文名。\n\n在习近平的领导下，共产党内部也在尝试转变其自身的体制。成千上万名干部和官员因不忠和腐败被纪律清洗。中国社会的政党化改造也在进行中，亿万富豪和名人们被迫放弃自私、肤浅和受西方影响的行为，宣誓更好地为党服务。\n\n方然是这三位行动者中最早被消失的。26岁的方然当时正在香港大学攻读社会学博士学位，撰写关于中国内地工人赋权的论文。根据其父亲的讲述，方然也是一名共产党员。据报道，其父亲方建忠曾在微信发信息为方然公开呼救，该消息在被审查删除之前在网络上之后信息在网络上被广泛传播。\n\n他的父亲写道：“方然绝不是破坏党的事业的犯罪分子，而是有利于我们党的事业的有志青年”。他说国家安全部门以“颠覆国家政权”为由将方然进行“指定居所监视居住”。\n\n本报看到了其父亲发的信息但无法联系到父亲进行信息确认，方然的朋友表示信息属实。带走方然的南宁国安部门，也没有立即回应来自本报的质询。本报亦无法联系上南宁市公安局。\n\n方然的一位大学同学Abner Law说，他有一种很朴实简单的“社会正义感”。方然经常在微信发表有关工人权利、性骚扰以及对城市外来人员的驱赶等社会问题的帖子。他来往于中国南方的工厂区，投身于工人的生活，并曾在工人尝试罢工或寻求工伤赔偿时给予支持。\n\n“他是一个真正寻求真理的人”，22岁的Law说 ，“虽然他在做劳工研究，但他不会死守任何意识形态或教条，像马克思主义或是别的什么...他是真的很热衷于帮助别人”。\n\nLaw说，方然已多次因为对劳工议题的关注而被叫去“喝茶”——这是一种在中国受到安全部门威胁的委婉说法。但他并没有被吓倒。二月，他做了一次关于1970年代南韩专制统治下劳工运动发展的线上分享。\n\n八月，他回到中国大陆做田野调查。国安部门在八月下旬再次叫他“喝茶”；从那之后，就再没有听过方然的消息。尽管一位要求匿名以保护自己的亲友表示，方然正在接受“教育”，应该能“很快”出去。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M84CQA7.png)\n\n<center>王建兵致力于帮助建筑业工人，他们因尘肺病或职业性肺病处于垂死状况中。他们在中国是最被忽视的人群中的一部分。（图片来自雪饼的朋友）</center>\n\n在方然被消失后没多久，王建兵和黄雪琴在9月19日去机场的路上失踪。黄雪琴是一名独立记者和#MeToo行动者，她获得了著名的志奋领奖学金，将前往英国萨克塞斯大学（​​University of Sussex）进行“性别、暴力与冲突”的硕士项目学习。\n\n38岁的王建兵，是一名劳工权利行动者，他经常邀请志同道合的年轻人在家里聚会。那天王准备给黄送机，但之后两人的电话就无法接通。据朋友的消息，在失联一天内，警察去到王在甘肃的老家，警告家人保持沉默。在广州，警察搜查了王建兵和黄雪琴两人的住处，并登录了王的脸书（facebook）账号。\n\n当局阻挠了家人询问王的被捕信息的请求，并拒绝了他们聘请的律师。警察也传唤和审讯40多位与两人相关的朋友，其中一些甚至被连续讯问24小时。朋友们的家也被搜查，警察还拷贝了他们电子设备上的文件。\n\n很多被问讯的人是因为被安装在王家附近的摄像头拍下了人脸照片。朋友们说，警方逼迫他们签署虚假供述，指控王建兵和黄雪琴日常聚会中批评政府。\n\n王的朋友Rio说，这种说法很荒谬。他说，他和其他年轻人这所以每周会在建兵家聚会，是因为大家都有共通的“政治性抑郁”。大多数时候，他们品茶、吃水果和分享个人故事，有时侯玩玩儿麻将或者去爬山。“仅是在家里的聚会就是想要颠覆国家政权的想法不可思议”，Rio说，“我们都很现实，我们从未自信的认为我们可以整整改变这个社会的结构压迫。在这个时代，在这个每个人都很压抑的时刻，我们只想能保有多一点点尊严地活着...能和朋友们在一起。”\n\n王建兵致力于帮助因为尘肺病或职业性肺病处于垂死状态的建筑工人，他们在中国是最被忽视的人群中的一部分。他们中的大多数人贫穷和已经死去。地方政府则经常骚扰任何为他们发声的人。王没有任何资金和政治影响力，但他多年帮助他们，经常去探访他们，让他们在濒死的日子里不那么寂寞。Rio说，“他注重倾听他人，他尊重每一个人，相信每个人都有尊严”。\n\n11月5日，在王建兵失踪一个多月后，他的家人收到了警方的通知，告知王于10月27日被以“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被正式逮捕。黄的家人也在10月底收到了类似的通知书。\n\n在被问到王、黄的消息时，广州市公安局说个案不便置评，官方说可以联系拘留所询问。本报多次拨打广州市第一看守所的电话都无人接听。据报道，黄王两人被关押在此处

Law说，他有一种很朴实简单的“社会正义感”。方然经常在微信发表有关工人权利、性骚扰以及对城市外来人员的驱赶等社会问题的帖子。他来往于中国南方的工厂区，投身于工人的生活，并曾在工人尝试罢工或寻求工伤赔偿时给予支持。\n\n“他是一个真正寻求真理的人”，22岁的Law说 ，“虽然他在做劳工研究，但他不会死守任何意识形态或教条，像马克思主义或是别的什么...他是真的很热衷于帮助别人”。\n\nLaw说，方然已多次因为对劳工议题的关注而被叫去“喝茶”——这是一种在中国受到安全部门威胁的委婉说法。但他并没有被吓倒。二月，他做了一次关于1970年代南韩专制统治下劳工运动发展的线上分享。\n\n八月，他回到中国大陆做田野调查。国安部门在八月下旬再次叫他“喝茶”；从那之后，就再没有听过方然的消息。尽管一位要求匿名以保护自己的亲友表示，方然正在接受“教育”，应该能“很快”出去。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M84CQA7.png)\n\n<center>王建兵致力于帮助建筑业工人，他们因尘肺病或职业性肺病处于垂死状况中。他们在中国是最被忽视的人群中的一部分。（图片来自雪饼的朋友）</center>\n\n在方然被消失后没多久，王建兵和黄雪琴在9月19日去机场的路上失踪。黄雪琴是一名独立记者和#MeToo行动者，她获得了著名的志奋领奖学金，将前往英国萨克塞斯大学（​​University of Sussex）进行“性别、暴力与冲突”的硕士项目学习。\n\n38岁的王建兵，是一名劳工权利行动者，他经常邀请志同道合的年轻人在家里聚会。那天王准备给黄送机，但之后两人的电话就无法接通。据朋友的消息，在失联一天内，警察去到王在甘肃的老家，警告家人保持沉默。在广州，警察搜查了王建兵和黄雪琴两人的住处，并登录了王的脸书（facebook）账号。\n\n当局阻挠了家人询问王的被捕信息的请求，并拒绝了他们聘请的律师。警察也传唤和审讯40多位与两人相关的朋友，其中一些甚至被连续讯问24小时。朋友们的家也被搜查，警察还拷贝了他们电子设备上的文件。\n\n很多被问讯的人是因为被安装在王家附近的摄像头拍下了人脸照片。朋友们说，警方逼迫他们签署虚假供述，指控王建兵和黄雪琴日常聚会中批评政府。\n\n王的朋友Rio说，这种说法很荒谬。他说，他和其他年轻人这所以每周会在建兵家聚会，是因为大家都有共通的“政治性抑郁”。大多数时候，他们品茶、吃水果和分享个人故事，有时侯玩玩儿麻将或者去爬山。“仅是在家里的聚会就是想要颠覆国家政权的想法不可思议”，Rio说，“我们都很现实，我们从未自信的认为我们可以整整改变这个社会的结构压迫。在这个时代，在这个每个人都很压抑的时刻，我们只想能保有多一点点尊严地活着...能和朋友们在一起。”\n\n王建兵致力于帮助因为尘肺病或职业性肺病处于垂死状态的建筑工人，他们在中国是最被忽视的人群中的一部分。他们中的大多数人贫穷和已经死去。地方政府则经常骚扰任何为他们发声的人。王没有任何资金和政治影响力，但他多年帮助他们，经常去探访他们，让他们在濒死的日子里不那么寂寞。Rio说，“他注重倾听他人，他尊重每一个人，相信每个人都有尊严”。\n\n11月5日，在王建兵失踪一个多月后，他的家人收到了警方的通知，告知王于10月27日被以“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被正式逮捕。黄的家人也在10月底收到了类似的通知书。\n\n在被问到王、黄的消息时，广州市公安局说个案不便置评，官方说可以联系拘留所询问。本报多次拨打广州市第一看守所的电话都无人接听。据报道，黄王两人被关押在此处

of Sussex）进行“性别、暴力与冲突”的硕士项目学习。</p>\n<p>38岁的王建兵，是一名劳工权利行动者，他经常邀请志同道合的年轻人在家里聚会。那天王准备给黄送机，但之后两人的电话就无法接通。据朋友的消息，在失联一天内，警察去到王在甘肃的老家，警告家人保持沉默。在广州，警察搜查了王建兵和黄雪琴两人的住处，并登录了王的脸书（facebook）账号。</p>\n<p>当局阻挠了家人询问王的被捕信息的请求，并拒绝了他们聘请的律师。警察也传唤和审讯40多位与两人相关的朋友，其中一些甚至被连续讯问24小时。朋友们的家也被搜查，警察还拷贝了他们电子设备上的文件。</p>\n<p>很多被问讯的人是因为被安装在王家附近的摄像头拍下了人脸照片。朋友们说，警方逼迫他们签署虚假供述，指控王建兵和黄雪琴日常聚会中批评政府。</p>\n<p>王的朋友Rio说，这种说法很荒谬。他说，他和其他年轻人这所以每周会在建兵家聚会，是因为大家都有共通的“政治性抑郁”。大多数时候，他们品茶、吃水果和分享个人故事，有时侯玩玩儿麻将或者去爬山。“仅是在家里的聚会就是想要颠覆国家政权的想法不可思议”，Rio说，“我们都很现实，我们从未自信的认为我们可以整整改变这个社会的结构压迫。在这个时代，在这个每个人都很压抑的时刻，我们只想能保有多一点点尊严地活着…能和朋友们在一起。”</p>\n<p>王建兵致力于帮助因为尘肺病或职业性肺病处于垂死状态的建筑工人，他们在中国是最被忽视的人群中的一部分。他们中的大多数人贫穷和已经死去。地方政府则经常骚扰任何为他们发声的人。王没有任何资金和政治影响力，但他多年帮助他们，经常去探访他们，让他们在濒死的日子里不那么寂寞。Rio说，“他注重倾听他人，他尊重每一个人，相信每个人都有尊严”。</p>\n<p>11月5日，在王建兵失踪一个多月后，他的家人收到了警方的通知，告知王于10月27日被以“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被正式逮捕。黄的家人也在10月底收到了类似的通知书。</p>\n<p>在被问到王、黄的消息时，广州市公安局说个案不便置评，官方说可以联系拘留所询问。本报多次拨打广州市第一看守所的电话都无人接听。据报道，黄王两人被关押在此处 。</p>\n<p>33岁的黄雪琴曾经被拘留过。2019年，警方阻止她前往香港攻读法学硕士学位。因为在网上发表关于香港民主抗议的文章，她被指定居所监视居住3个月。在被释放后的一年里，她仍然处于监控之下，一个特别的摄像头被安装在她住处的楼梯间。她在摄像头前举牌抗议非法监控；她还对着镜头唱“你听到人民在歌唱吗？（Do you hear the people sing）”。她向国宝展示信息公开申请，要求公开花在该监控上的公共财政支出。有一天，当黄准确去镜头前朗读抗议诗歌时，她发现摄像头已经不在了。她在网上把这次经历写成了帖子，并加上“#抗争有用”的话题标签。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QSJcqWY.png\"></p>\n<center>黄雪琴，调查过中国#MeToo (米兔)案件，在2019年也被捕过，当时中国公安阻止她前往香港攻读法学硕士。（图片来自雪饼的朋友）</center>\n\n<p>黄还撰文讲述其他女权和劳工权利运动者面对的压制，包括一篇获奖的文章，该文章记录了李翘楚的故事：李翘楚，30岁，曾因“煽动颠覆国家政权”的罪名被指定居所监视居住四个月；她曾在2020年6月被释放，但因为她在网上声援她的伴侣–公民运动倡导者许志永–在拘留中遭遇的恶劣对待，在今年2月又再次被捕。</p>\n<p>李在她讲述其被关押期间经历的文章中说道：“那种屈辱感在之后很长一段时间里仍然困扰着我”。警卫强迫她朗读数十篇批判许志永的文章，“那感觉就像我想咬舌自尽但不成功，之后还要用残存的舌头去唱赞歌”。</p>\n<p>黄雪琴的护照今年被警方归还。她的朋友说，意味着警方那应该将不会再对她出境进行干涉。但，她们错了。</p>\n<p>“我感到非常无助”，Rio说，“他们需要帮助，但我能做的只能盲目无助地担心…,你只能等着看看他们什么时候会被定罪、会被判入狱多久。你面对着这个政府所做的一些，它的任何秘密行动，你都无能为力。”</p>\n<p>Rio说，过去唯一能抵御这种恐惧感的，是跟信任的朋友们聚在一起，一起欢笑，感受到自己被理解，自己也并不孤单…但现在，即便是这样也已经是危险的了。</p>\n<p>作者：Alice

before the 2021 International Human Rights Day, the community of UK's Chevening Scholarship Alumni released a joint letter to express solidarity with detained Chinese feminist journalist Huang Xueqin and her friend, an occupational disease activist, Wang Jianbing\n\n\n\n**連署亮點**：全球超過30個國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共112位Chevening志奮領獎學金學人簽署聲援公開信，要求英國外交部與其旗下志奮領獎學金，公開表態支持失聯的中國女權記者黃雪琴與職業病權益倡導者王建兵，並開啟針對本案不限層級的對中人權對話。\n\nA total of 112 Chevening scholars from across 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021, have signed a letter of solidarity. The letter requests the UK's Foreign Ministry and Chevening to publicly support detained Chinese feminist journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease activist Wang Jianbing, and to have an open dialogue about human rights with the Chinese government.\n\n\n\n\n\n中國女權記者與#metoo行動家黃雪琴為英國Chevening（志奮領）2021/22獎學金的中國得主，原計劃於9月20日經深圳前往香港機場，飛赴英國University of Sussex留學，其友職業病權益倡導者王建兵（暱稱「煎餅」）則原計劃於當天爲其送行。然而，兩人於今年9月19日下午3點，啟程赴英前夕，在王建兵廣州家中失聯超過兩個月。\n\nChinese independent investigative journalist and #Metoo activist Huang Xueqin is the Chinese winner of the 2021/22 Chevening scholarship. She planned to arrive at Hong Kong airport from Guangzhou first and then fly from there to the University of Sussex in the UK to start her postgraduate program on September 20. Her friend, an occupational disease activist, Wang Jianbing (known as \"pancake,\" or jianbing in Chinese), planned to accompany her off at the airport. Yet at 3 pm, September 19, on the eve of Huang's departure, they were both detained at Wang Jianbing's home in Guangzhou. It has been over two months since that happened.\n\n\n\n直至11月5日，王建兵家屬於收到廣州市公安局發出的編號「穗公捕通字[2021]X2逮捕通知書」後，才正式確認王建兵已於10月27日被廣州市公安局以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權」的名義被執行逮捕，現拘留於廣州市第一看守所。過程中，王建兵的律師多次申請會見和取保候審，皆被中國警方拒絕，家屬與律師至今無法會見受關押的王建兵與黃雪琴（簡稱：「雪餅」）。\n\nOn November 5, Wang Jianbing's family received from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau a \"notice of arrest\" numbered \"[2021] x 2.\" It officially confirmed that Wang Jianbing was arrested under the charge of \" Inciting subversion of state power.” He is currently detained at Guangzhou’s Number 1 Detention Center. During this period, Wang Jianbing's lawyer tried several times to meet him and apply for his release on bail. Yet these requests were rejected by the Chinese authorities. Until now, family members of the two detainees (known together as “Xuebing\"(Snow Pellets), a Chinese cookie) have not been able to meet them.\n\n\n\n該政治打壓案件至今已陸續獲得Amnesty International (國際特赦)、Reporters Without Borders (無國界記者)、International Federation of Journalists、Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中國人權捍衛者）及The Coalition For Women in Journalism（女性新聞工作者聯盟）等國際組織的關注與聲援。（詳見：https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/）\n\n由於黃雪琴的Chevening（志奮領）獎學金得主身份，及其在女權與言論自由上的持續貢獻，此案件已引起全球Chevening（志奮領）校友社群得關注。\n\nThis case of political repression has received the attention and support of many international groups, such as Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, International Federation of Journalists, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and The Coalition For Women in Journalism. (For details, please check https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/.) As a winner of the UK Chevening scholarship and a restless fighter for the freedom of expression and women's rights, Huang Xueqin’s experience has evoked serious concerns within the Chevening alumni community.\n\n\n\n志奮領校友發起全球連署，短短一週內就搜集到超過30國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共計112位志奮領校友在第一階段加入連署，聲援「0919雪餅案」。簽署者最大宗依序來自哥倫比亞、巴西、印度、台灣、墨西哥及南非，展現志奮領獎學金社群對本案的強烈關注，以及對英國外交部與志奮領獎學金在此案件上有所表態與作為的正面期待。\n\n\nThe community soon released an open letter. Within one week since the start of the petition, they collected signatures from 112 Chevening alumni across over 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021. Most signatories came from Colombia, Brazil, India, Taiwan, Mexico, and South Africa. These signatures demonstrate that the Chevening alumni are paying close attention to the suffering of the two detainees. There is an expectation within the community that the UK Foreign Ministry and Chevening will take a stance and act positively on this case.\n\n\n\n\n「英國政府已於11月20日發表聲明，呼籲中國當局應提供可驗證的證據，對外說明女網球星彭帥的安危和下落。英國政府當然也必須針對中國記者黃雪琴的失蹤表達關切，因為她已經獲得英國政府提供的志奮領獎學金，卻在九月要離開廣州、前往Sussex大學進修的前一天人間蒸發」畢業於Loughborough University的志奮領獎學金校友，來自台灣的呂秉原說。\n\n“The UK government has released a statement on 20 November 2021 to urge the Chinese authorities to provide verifiable evidence of tennis star Peng Shuai’s safety and whereabouts. It, of course, also needs to express its concerns over the disappearance of Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin, who has been awarded the UK government’s Chevening scholarship but went missing one day before she was scheduled to leave Guangzhou in September to study at the University of Sussex.\" said Chevening Scholarship alumnus and a graduate of Loughborough University, Edward Pingyuan from Taiwan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n「黃雪琴是中國一個優秀的記者和女性主義行動者，認識她的朋友都會覺得她nice, 謙和，非常的有能量，是一個完全優秀的志奮領學人。如今在她即將赴英國的路程中被拘留，英國政府和志奮領至今未曾對此發出過任何的聲明和公開的表達，讓我們感到十分的痛心和難過，她如此優秀如此deserve這個獎學金和海外自由學習的氛圍，真希望志奮領能幫助她獲得更好的對待和生活」一位不願透露姓名與獎學金得獎年份的中國志奮領獎學金得主說。\n\n\"Huang Xueqin is a brilliant journalist and women's rights activist. Friends who know her well describe her as nice, modest, and extremely competent. She is an outstanding Chevening scholar. She was detained when she was about to leave for the UK. The UK government and Chevening have not spoken out publicly about this case, which makes us extremely sad and disappointed. She is remarkable and deserves this scholarship. She should be able to study abroad freely. We hope that Chevening can help her obtain better treatment and a better life,\" said an anonymous Chevening alumnus from China.\n\n\n\n該全球連署除了要求英國外交部旗下的志奮領獎學金發布全球校友信件，比照該獎學金對於其他人權事件的關注，積極呼籲全球志奮領獎學金社群以關注「0919雪餅案」外；更訴求英國外交部及志奮領獎學金針對「0919雪餅案」，展開不限層級的對中人權對話，以保障黃雪琴與王建兵的權利。該全球連署文末，則近一步要求中國當局立即釋放黃雪琴與王建兵。\n\nThe open letter requests the Chevening Scholarship, which is affiliated to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to publish a letter to the global alumni community, asking them to show concerns over the \"0919 Xuebing case,\" as well as to pay more attention to human rights issues in general. In addition, it demands the FCDO and the Chevening leadership to initiate an open dialogue with the Chinese government on this case and to uphold the rights the two detainees deserve. The last part of the letter asks the Chinese authorities to immediately release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\n\n\n此連署已於2021年12月8日公開在本案件官方網站、twitter以及其臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」。同時，已於此前透過英國外館寄發至英國外交部與志奮領獎學金秘書處，目前尚無收到任何回應。\n\nThis letter was published on December 8 (GMT+8) on the official website for the \"0919 Xuebing case,\" as well as on Twitter and the Facebook page \"Free Xueqin & Jianbing.\" Meanwhile, the letter has been sent to the FCDO and the Chevening Secretariat.

She planned to arrive at Hong Kong airport from Guangzhou first and then fly from there to the University of Sussex in the UK to start her postgraduate program on September 20. Her friend, an occupational disease activist, Wang Jianbing (known as “pancake,” or jianbing in Chinese), planned to accompany her off at the airport. Yet at 3 pm, September 19, on the eve of Huang’s departure, they were both detained at Wang Jianbing’s home in Guangzhou. It has been over two months since that happened.</p>\n<p>直至11月5日，王建兵家屬於收到廣州市公安局發出的編號「穗公捕通字[2021]X2逮捕通知書」後，才正式確認王建兵已於10月27日被廣州市公安局以涉嫌「煽動顛覆國家政權」的名義被執行逮捕，現拘留於廣州市第一看守所。過程中，王建兵的律師多次申請會見和取保候審，皆被中國警方拒絕，家屬與律師至今無法會見受關押的王建兵與黃雪琴（簡稱：「雪餅」）。</p>\n<p>On November 5, Wang Jianbing’s family received from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau a “notice of arrest” numbered “[2021] x 2.” It officially confirmed that Wang Jianbing was arrested under the charge of “ Inciting subversion of state power.” He is currently detained at Guangzhou’s Number 1 Detention Center. During this period, Wang Jianbing’s lawyer tried several times to meet him and apply for his release on bail. Yet these requests were rejected by the Chinese authorities. Until now, family members of the two detainees (known together as “Xuebing”(Snow Pellets), a Chinese cookie) have not been able to meet them.</p>\n<p>該政治打壓案件至今已陸續獲得Amnesty International (國際特赦)、Reporters Without Borders (無國界記者)、International Federation of Journalists、Chinese Human Rights Defenders(中國人權捍衛者）及The Coalition For Women in Journalism（女性新聞工作者聯盟）等國際組織的關注與聲援。（詳見：<a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/%EF%BC%89\">https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/）</a></p>\n<p>由於黃雪琴的Chevening（志奮領）獎學金得主身份，及其在女權與言論自由上的持續貢獻，此案件已引起全球Chevening（志奮領）校友社群得關注。</p>\n<p>This case of political repression has received the attention and support of many international groups, such as Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, International Federation of Journalists, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and The Coalition For Women in Journalism. (For details, please check <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/\">https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/</a>.) As a winner of the UK Chevening scholarship and a restless fighter for the freedom of expression and women’s rights, Huang Xueqin’s experience has evoked serious concerns within the Chevening alumni community.</p>\n<p>志奮領校友發起全球連署，短短一週內就搜集到超過30國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共計112位志奮領校友在第一階段加入連署，聲援「0919雪餅案」。簽署者最大宗依序來自哥倫比亞、巴西、印度、台灣、墨西哥及南非，展現志奮領獎學金社群對本案的強烈關注，以及對英國外交部與志奮領獎學金在此案件上有所表態與作為的正面期待。</p>\n<p>The community soon released an open letter. Within one week since the start of the petition, they collected signatures from 112 Chevening alumni across over 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021. Most signatories came from Colombia, Brazil, India, Taiwan, Mexico, and South Africa. These signatures demonstrate that the Chevening alumni are paying close attention to the suffering of the two detainees. There is an expectation within the community that the UK Foreign Ministry and Chevening will take a stance and act positively on this case.</p>\n<p>「英國政府已於11月20日發表聲明，呼籲中國當局應提供可驗證的證據，對外說明女網球星彭帥的安危和下落。英國政府當然也必須針對中國記者黃雪琴的失蹤表達關切，因為她已經獲得英國政府提供的志奮領獎學金，卻在九月要離開廣州、前往Sussex大學進修的前一天人間蒸發」畢業於Loughborough University的志奮領獎學金校友，來自台灣的呂秉原說。</p>\n<p>“The UK government has released a statement on 20 November 2021 to urge the Chinese authorities to provide verifiable evidence of tennis star Peng Shuai’s safety and whereabouts. It, of course, also needs to express its concerns over the disappearance of Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin, who has been awarded the UK government’s Chevening scholarship but went missing one day before she was scheduled to leave Guangzhou in September to study at the University of Sussex.” said Chevening Scholarship alumnus and a graduate of Loughborough University, Edward Pingyuan from Taiwan. </p>\n<p>「黃雪琴是中國一個優秀的記者和女性主義行動者，認識她的朋友都會覺得她nice, 謙和，非常的有能量，是一個完全優秀的志奮領學人。如今在她即將赴英國的路程中被拘留，英國政府和志奮領至今未曾對此發出過任何的聲明和公開的表達，讓我們感到十分的痛心和難過，她如此優秀如此deserve這個獎學金和海外自由學習的氛圍，真希望志奮領能幫助她獲得更好的對待和生活」一位不願透露姓名與獎學金得獎年份的中國志奮領獎學金得主說。</p>\n<p>“Huang Xueqin is a brilliant journalist and women’s rights activist. Friends who know her well describe her as nice, modest, and extremely competent. She is an outstanding Chevening scholar. She was detained when she was about to leave for the UK. The UK government and Chevening have not spoken out publicly about this case, which makes us extremely sad and disappointed. She is remarkable and deserves this scholarship. She should be able to study abroad freely. We hope that Chevening can help her obtain better treatment and a better life,” said an anonymous Chevening alumnus from China.</p>\n<p>該全球連署除了要求英國外交部旗下的志奮領獎學金發布全球校友信件，比照該獎學金對於其他人權事件的關注，積極呼籲全球志奮領獎學金社群以關注「0919雪餅案」外；更訴求英國外交部及志奮領獎學金針對「0919雪餅案」，展開不限層級的對中人權對話，以保障黃雪琴與王建兵的權利。該全球連署文末，則近一步要求中國當局立即釋放黃雪琴與王建兵。</p>\n<p>The open letter requests the Chevening Scholarship, which is affiliated to the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) to publish a letter to the global alumni community, asking them to show concerns over the “0919 Xuebing case,” as well as to pay more attention to human rights issues in general. In addition, it demands the FCDO and the Chevening leadership to initiate an open dialogue with the Chinese government on this case and to uphold the rights the two detainees deserve. The last part of the letter asks the Chinese authorities to immediately release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>此連署已於2021年12月8日公開在本案件官方網站、twitter以及其臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&amp;Jianbing王建兵」。同時，已於此前透過英國外館寄發至英國外交部與志奮領獎學金秘書處，目前尚無收到任何回應。</p>\n<p>This letter was published on December 8 (GMT+8) on the official website for the “0919 Xuebing case,” as well as on Twitter and the Facebook page “Free Xueqin &amp; Jianbing.” Meanwhile, the letter has been sent to the FCDO and the Chevening Secretariat.

(For details, please check <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/\">https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/</a>.) As a winner of the UK Chevening scholarship and a restless fighter for the freedom of expression and women’s rights, Huang Xueqin’s experience has evoked serious concerns within the Chevening alumni community.</p>\n<p>志奮領校友發起全球連署，短短一週內就搜集到超過30國家，年份橫跨1995年至2021年，共計112位志奮領校友在第一階段加入連署，聲援「0919雪餅案」。簽署者最大宗依序來自哥倫比亞、巴西、印度、台灣、墨西哥及南非，展現志奮領獎學金社群對本案的強烈關注，以及對英國外交部與志奮領獎學金在此案件上有所表態與作為的正面期待。</p>\n<p>The community soon released an open letter. Within one week since the start of the petition, they collected signatures from 112 Chevening alumni across over 30 countries, who received the scholarship between 1995 and 2021. Most signatories came from Colombia, Brazil, India, Taiwan, Mexico, and South Africa. These signatures demonstrate that the Chevening alumni are paying close attention to the suffering of the two detainees. There is an expectation within the community that the UK Foreign Ministry and Chevening will take a stance and act positively on this case.</p>\n<p>「英國政府已於11月20日發表聲明，呼籲中國當局應提供可驗證的證據，對外說明女網球星彭帥的安危和下落。英國政府當然也必須針對中國記者黃雪琴的失蹤表達關切，因為她已經獲得英國政府提供的志奮領獎學金，卻在九月要離開廣州、前往Sussex大學進修的前一天人間蒸發」畢業於Loughborough University的志奮領獎學金校友，來自台灣的呂秉原說。</p>\n<p>“The UK government has released a statement on 20 November 2021 to urge the Chinese authorities to provide verifiable evidence of tennis star Peng Shuai’s safety and whereabouts. It, of course, also needs to express its concerns over the disappearance of Chinese journalist Huang Xueqin, who has been awarded the UK government’s Chevening scholarship but went missing one day before she was scheduled to leave Guangzhou in September to study at the University of Sussex.” said Chevening Scholarship alumnus and a graduate of Loughborough University, Edward Pingyuan from Taiwan. </p>\n<p>「黃雪琴是中國一個優秀的記者和女性主義行動者，認識她的朋友都會覺得她nice, 謙和，非常的有能量，是一個完全優秀的志奮領學人。如今在她即將赴英國的路程中被拘留，英國政府和志奮領至今未曾對此發出過任何的聲明和公開的表達，讓我們感到十分的痛心和難過，她如此優秀如此deserve這個獎學金和海外自由學習的氛圍，真希望志奮領能幫助她獲得更好的對待和生活」一位不願透露姓名與獎學金得獎年份的中國志奮領獎學金得主說。</p>\n<p>“Huang Xueqin is a brilliant journalist and women’s rights activist. Friends who know her well describe her as nice, modest, and extremely competent. She is an outstanding Chevening scholar. She was detained when she was about to leave for the UK. The UK government and Chevening have not spoken out publicly about this case, which makes us extremely sad and disappointed. She is remarkable and deserves this scholarship. She should be able to study abroad freely. We hope that Chevening can help her obtain better treatment and a better life,” said an anonymous Chevening alumnus from China.</p>\n<p>該全球連署除了要求英國外交部旗下的志奮領獎學金發布全球校友信件，比照該獎學金對於其他人權事件的關注，積極呼籲全球志奮領獎學金社群以關注「0919雪餅案」外；更訴求英國外交部及志奮領獎學金針對「0919雪餅案」，展開不限層級的對中人權對話，以保障黃雪琴與王建兵的權利。該全球連署文末，則近一步要求中國當局立即釋放黃雪琴與王建兵。</p>\n<p>The open letter requests the Chevening Scholarship, which is affiliated to the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) to publish a letter to the global alumni community, asking them to show concerns over the “0919 Xuebing case,” as well as to pay more attention to human rights issues in general. In addition, it demands the FCDO and the Chevening leadership to initiate an open dialogue with the Chinese government on this case and to uphold the rights the two detainees deserve. The last part of the letter asks the Chinese authorities to immediately release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>此連署已於2021年12月8日公開在本案件官方網站、twitter以及其臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&amp;Jianbing王建兵」。同時，已於此前透過英國外館寄發至英國外交部與志奮領獎學金秘書處，目前尚無收到任何回應。</p>\n<p>This letter was published on December 8 (GMT+8) on the official website for the “0919 Xuebing case,” as well as on Twitter and the Facebook page “Free Xueqin &amp; Jianbing.” Meanwhile, the letter has been sent to the FCDO and the Chevening Secretariat.

Support of a 2021/22 Chevening Scholar, Huang Xueqin, and Her Fellow, Wang Jianbing 全球聯合聲明：英國Chevening校友社群聲援Chevening獎學金2021/22中國得主黃雪琴與其同伴王建兵","date":"2021-12-07T07:52:48.971Z","_content":"6 Dec. 2021\n\n中文版在最下方\n\n- Call for continued international attention to the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang Xueqin, a Chevening scholar, and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on FCDO and the Chevening leadership for a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on Chevening Leadership to send a Chevening Alumni Email/Letter to the Chevening community to explain the situation of the case of Chevenor Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\nDear Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Chevening Leadership team,\n\nI have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).\n\nWe are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.\n\nHuang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.\n\nCredible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.\n\nWe express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.\n\nChevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.\n\nLast but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

呼籲志奮領總部向志奮領校友社群發一封校友郵件，說明志奮領獎學金得主黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵的人權案件情況\n- 敦促中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵\n- 呼籲國際社會繼續關注志奮領學者黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵被任意關押的人權現況\n\n\n\n\n尊敬的外交、聯邦和發展辦公室 (FCDO) 和志奮領領導團隊，\n\n我有幸代表 112 位志奮領學者（Chevenors）發表聯合聲明。\n\n我們對黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵被任意監禁的人權現況，且家屬與律師無法探視的狀況，表示嚴重關切。\n\n黃雪琴是志奮領學者中國2021/22得主，原計劃於今年9月前往英國在薩塞克斯大學就讀研究所學位。她是中國#Metoo運動活動家和獨立調查記者。\n\n國際媒體和持續追蹤此人權個案的臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」發布的可信消息顯示，黃雪琴與好友王建兵於今年9月19日被中國廣東省廣州市警方秘密逮捕，家屬與律師至今未能會見。\n\n我們對中國當局任意逮捕和拘留黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵表示極度關切，因為這似乎只是為了懲罰她和她的同伴的合法人權活動。\n\n志奮領獎學金是世界上最具影響力的獎學金之一，崇尚寬容、公平和社會正義的價值觀。志奮領秘書處透過校友電子郵件，不斷更新志奮領網絡上的精彩故事，也分享了衝突國家的局勢，比如阿富汗的現狀。這些校友郵件為志奮領社區提供了創新理念和世界人權狀況的重要信息。因此，我們敦促志奮領領導與我們站在一起，透過寄發校友郵件，呼籲整體志奮領社區關注黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件。我們敦促志奮領領導層與我們站在一起，公開呼籲釋放志奮領黃雪琴和她的同伴。我們還敦促 FDCO 就黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件，與中國當局展開佈線層級的人權對話。\n\n最後，我們要求中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵。\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

incommunicado detention of Huang Xueqin, a Chevening scholar, and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on FCDO and the Chevening leadership for a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Call on Chevening Leadership to send a Chevening Alumni Email/Letter to the Chevening community to explain the situation of the case of Chevenor Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing\n- Urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\n\nDear Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Chevening Leadership team,\n\nI have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).\n\nWe are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.\n\nHuang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.\n\nCredible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.\n\nWe express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.\n\nChevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.\n\nLast but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

呼籲志奮領總部向志奮領校友社群發一封校友郵件，說明志奮領獎學金得主黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵的人權案件情況\n- 敦促中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵\n- 呼籲國際社會繼續關注志奮領學者黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵被任意關押的人權現況\n\n\n\n\n尊敬的外交、聯邦和發展辦公室 (FCDO) 和志奮領領導團隊，\n\n我有幸代表 112 位志奮領學者（Chevenors）發表聯合聲明。\n\n我們對黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵被任意監禁的人權現況，且家屬與律師無法探視的狀況，表示嚴重關切。\n\n黃雪琴是志奮領學者中國2021/22得主，原計劃於今年9月前往英國在薩塞克斯大學就讀研究所學位。她是中國#Metoo運動活動家和獨立調查記者。\n\n國際媒體和持續追蹤此人權個案的臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」發布的可信消息顯示，黃雪琴與好友王建兵於今年9月19日被中國廣東省廣州市警方秘密逮捕，家屬與律師至今未能會見。\n\n我們對中國當局任意逮捕和拘留黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵表示極度關切，因為這似乎只是為了懲罰她和她的同伴的合法人權活動。\n\n志奮領獎學金是世界上最具影響力的獎學金之一，崇尚寬容、公平和社會正義的價值觀。志奮領秘書處透過校友電子郵件，不斷更新志奮領網絡上的精彩故事，也分享了衝突國家的局勢，比如阿富汗的現狀。這些校友郵件為志奮領社區提供了創新理念和世界人權狀況的重要信息。因此，我們敦促志奮領領導與我們站在一起，透過寄發校友郵件，呼籲整體志奮領社區關注黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件。我們敦促志奮領領導層與我們站在一起，公開呼籲釋放志奮領黃雪琴和她的同伴。我們還敦促 FDCO 就黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件，與中國當局展開佈線層級的人權對話。\n\n最後，我們要求中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵。\n\n[Full Version of Statement Download (Including Cosignatory

team,</p>\n<p>I have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).</p>\n<p>We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Huang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.</p>\n<p>Credible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.</p>\n<p>We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.</p>\n<p>Chevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p><a

delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).</p>\n<p>We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Huang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.</p>\n<p>Credible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.</p>\n<p>We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.</p>\n<p>Chevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.</p>\n<p><a

Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing!\n\nWe, members of the UK’s University and College Union (UCU), are calling on the Chinese authorities to release without delay Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.\n\nHuang is a well-known investigative journalist and #Metoo activist in China who was preparing to travel to the UK to undertake postgraduate study at the University of Sussex. Wang is a veteran workers’ and disability rights activist. Both are based in Guangdong province and were detained by the authorities on 19 September 2021. \n\nThey have since been formally charged with “inciting subversion of state power”. Amnesty International states that Huang Xueqin’s arrest shines “a light on the dire treatment of victims of sexual violence [and] also exemplifies the Chinese authorities’ hostility towards journalists who dare to report the truth”. Amnesty further stated: “Wang Jianbing, who has advocated for workers with disabilities and occupational diseases, is also facing a lengthy jail sentence on the same bogus ‘subversion’ charge. No one should face jail simply for defending workers’ rights.”\n\nWe call for Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing to be released immediately and unconditionally. We urge the entire UK labour movement to speak out and to raise its voice in support of our sister and brother activists in China.\n\n***\n\nPlease sign as an individual, but also feel free to put to your UCU branch etc if you can.\n\nThis statement was put together by activists in UCU. For more information email UCU rep Tim Pringle tp21@soas.ac.uk. If you indicate you wish to stay in touch we will contact you about coordinating and campaigning on this issue.

My friend, Sophia Huang Xueqin, had marked her 33rd birthday with a series of dinners and parties organised by her friends, complete with barbecue, karaoke, two separate birthday cakes and games of mahjong.\n\n<!-- more --> \n\nThe celebrations felt especially sweet as they were capping two difficult years for her. \n\nA Chinese investigative journalist who had risen to prominence by documenting the #MeToo movement in China, Sophia was coming off a rocky stretch that had included a three-month detention in 2019. \n\nThis was followed by a year and a half of close surveillance by police in her hometown, the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. \n\nNow, she was hoping she could finally leave the country. She had been admitted into a master’s programme at the University of Sussex to study gender, violence and conflict, and secured a prestigious Chevening scholarship, funded by the British government.\n\nThe last missing piece was the police’s approval to fly to Britain. \n\nPolice had told her that once she had her British visa and a plane ticket, she should call them and ask for permission to leave. Sophia was hopeful she would get it.\n\nSo the celebrations at the end of August doubled as a farewell party. “I was surrounded by love and joy, though I also knew I was being watched,” she wrote a few days later on her Facebook page.  \n\nShe received her British visa in early September. A few days later, she had booked a flight, leaving from Hong Kong. She called the police to ask if she could go. The voice on the other end of the phone told her, perhaps surprisingly: \n\n“Sure, you can leave. Would you like us to drive you to the airport?”\n\n“I rejected them nicely,” she told me in a message.\n\nOn September 19, she was planning to travel to the border city of Shenzhen accompanied by a friend, the one-time labour activist Wang Jianbing. From Shenzhen, she was going to cross the border into Hong Kong and board her flight the next day. \n\nBut that afternoon, friends lost contact with both Sophia and Jianbing. Calls and text messages went unanswered. \n\nThey had disappeared.\n\n## Thousands like her\n\nThousands of people disappear annually in China into a system called \"residential surveillance at a designated location\". A law passed in 2013 allows authorities to detain virtually anyone without charges and without notifying family. While more than 27,000 such disappearances have been documented by the Safeguard Defenders nonprofit since 2013, the real number could be much higher.\n\nRecently, the disappearance of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai made international headlines: she vanished from public view last month after accusing a former vice-premier of coercing her into sex. Other high-profile cases from recent years include the temporary disappearances of Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma and Hollywood actress Fan Bingbing. \n\nThousands of lesser-known activists, lawyers, businesspeople and officials have also gone missing. \n\nI reported often on such disappearances during my six years as a China correspondent. But Sophia’s case felt personal.\n\nI met her in December 2017, when I was writing about China’s fledgling #MeToo movement. \n\nShe had decided China needed a reckoning with sexual harassment similar to what the United States was experiencing. In January 2018, she broke the story of an engineer who accused her former professor at a prestigious Beijing school of sexual harassment. \n\nIn the beginning, Sophia was very cautious about not getting in the authorities’ crosshairs. \n\n“You have to think about what’s the safe line and what’s the red line,” she told me in the summer of 2018. “Of course, sometimes you really don’t know where it is until you touch it.”\n\n## The invisible line\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Sophia did unwittingly cross that line. \n\nShe was studying law in Hong Kong and joined the first massive anti-government protest of that summer. She wrote an essay about it, which she distributed on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. \n\nThat same night, around midnight, police turned up simultaneously at her partner’s and parents’ houses in Guangdong province, where Guangzhou is located, with the intent to take her away from wherever she was staying.  \n\nThey didn’t get her that evening, but she was detained in October 2019, when she returned to Guangzhou to renew her documents so she could continue her studies in Hong Kong. \n\nThe charge authorities eventually brought against her was “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” Sophia never spoke publicly about her detention but was planning to if authorities did prevent her from going to Britain, she told me. Even if that wouldn’t have secured her freedom, she wanted to hold them accountable.\n\nShe was held at a villa in Guangzhou, the location of which was unknown to her family and lawyers. During her months in detention, two police officers would stare at her for hours and scribble notes while she sat on a couch or walked around the room. \n\nShe was frequently interrogated. On occasion, police would sit her down and dissect passages from her diaries. They threatened to throw her into prison for many years. They tried to extract a written confession – a common practice in cases considered politically sensitive by authorities – but Sophia refused and insisted journalism was not a crime. \n\n## Making her life hell\n\nAfter her release, in January 2020, police asked that they meet monthly for dinners at some of the fanciest restaurants in Guangzhou, she told me. They also called for frequent meetings at her neighborhood Starbucks, though she had pleaded with them to meet at the police station instead. \n\nAfter her passport was returned to her this year, police encouraged her to travel outside the province so they could accompany her and have a trip on expenses. \n\nOn Chinese New Year 2021, they gifted her a red envelope with cash, and, when she refused to take it, they pressured a family member who was a public servant to accept it.\n\nI called the Guangzhou public security bureau several times last week for a reaction, but the calls went unanswered.\n\nSophia was frustrated with the amount of public funds police were spending to make her life hell. \n\nShe was also steeling herself against the mind games she felt she was being subjected to. The last time I saw her, in August, she told me that as long as she could continue to stand up for herself in front of her captors, it didn’t matter whether they would detain her again.\n\nWhen she was finally getting ready to leave the country, she was disappeared.\n\nMore than a month after Sophia and Jianbing’s disappearance, authorities notified their families that the pair were being investigated for “inciting to subvert state power,” though it’s unclear what events the charges refer to.   \n\nMore than 50 of their friends have been temporarily detained and interrogated since. Questions have focused on the weekly dinners that Jianbing would hold for friends at his home.\n\nLast week, the EU Delegation to China and a group of 112 Chevening scholars publicly asked for Sophia’s and Jianbing’s release – in a show of accountability the type of which Sophia had demonstrated throughout her career.\n\nSophia’s friends hope that international attention her case has attracted will lead to some sort of accountability. When she was detained in 2019, Chinese feminists abroad encouraged people to mail postcards to the detention centre in Guangzhou where she was initially held to let authorities know that they too were being watched.   \n\nI dare to hope that she will be freed again and allowed to pursue her studies abroad. But in today’s China, there is no telling when that might happen.\n\n[Source](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/12/18/china-friend-won-scholarship-study-britain-vanished/)\n","source":"_posts/china-my-friend-scholarship.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: \"【雪饼的朋友心声】China: My friend won a scholarship to study in Britain, then\n  vanished Subtitle: Sophia Huang Xueqin is one of thousands who are\n  'disappeared' every year in China\"\ndate: 2021-12-19T09:34:13.687Z\ncategories:\n  - 雪饼的朋友心声\ntags:\n  - English\n---\nBy Simina Mistreanu\n18 December 2021 • 6:00am\n\nIt had been a weekend of celebrations.

She wrote an essay about it, which she distributed on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. \n\nThat same night, around midnight, police turned up simultaneously at her partner’s and parents’ houses in Guangdong province, where Guangzhou is located, with the intent to take her away from wherever she was staying.  \n\nThey didn’t get her that evening, but she was detained in October 2019, when she returned to Guangzhou to renew her documents so she could continue her studies in Hong Kong. \n\nThe charge authorities eventually brought against her was “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” Sophia never spoke publicly about her detention but was planning to if authorities did prevent her from going to Britain, she told me. Even if that wouldn’t have secured her freedom, she wanted to hold them accountable.\n\nShe was held at a villa in Guangzhou, the location of which was unknown to her family and lawyers. During her months in detention, two police officers would stare at her for hours and scribble notes while she sat on a couch or walked around the room. \n\nShe was frequently interrogated. On occasion, police would sit her down and dissect passages from her diaries. They threatened to throw her into prison for many years. They tried to extract a written confession – a common practice in cases considered politically sensitive by authorities – but Sophia refused and insisted journalism was not a crime. \n\n## Making her life hell\n\nAfter her release, in January 2020, police asked that they meet monthly for dinners at some of the fanciest restaurants in Guangzhou, she told me. They also called for frequent meetings at her neighborhood Starbucks, though she had pleaded with them to meet at the police station instead. \n\nAfter her passport was returned to her this year, police encouraged her to travel outside the province so they could accompany her and have a trip on expenses. \n\nOn Chinese New Year 2021, they gifted her a red envelope with cash, and, when she refused to take it, they pressured a family member who was a public servant to accept it.\n\nI called the Guangzhou public security bureau several times last week for a reaction, but the calls went unanswered.\n\nSophia was frustrated with the amount of public funds police were spending to make her life hell. \n\nShe was also steeling herself against the mind games she felt she was being subjected to. The last time I saw her, in August, she told me that as long as she could continue to stand up for herself in front of her captors, it didn’t matter whether they would detain her again.\n\nWhen she was finally getting ready to leave the country, she was disappeared.\n\nMore than a month after Sophia and Jianbing’s disappearance, authorities notified their families that the pair were being investigated for “inciting to subvert state power,” though it’s unclear what events the charges refer to.   \n\nMore than 50 of their friends have been temporarily detained and interrogated since. Questions have focused on the weekly dinners that Jianbing would hold for friends at his home.\n\nLast week, the EU Delegation to China and a group of 112 Chevening scholars publicly asked for Sophia’s and Jianbing’s release – in a show of accountability the type of which Sophia had demonstrated throughout her career.\n\nSophia’s friends hope that international attention her case has attracted will lead to some sort of accountability. When she was detained in 2019, Chinese feminists abroad encouraged people to mail postcards to the detention centre in Guangzhou where she was initially held to let authorities know that they too were being watched.   \n\nI dare to hope that she will be freed again and allowed to pursue her studies abroad. But in today’s China, there is no telling when that might happen.\n\n[Source](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/12/18/china-friend-won-scholarship-study-britain-vanished/)\n","slug":"china-my-friend-scholarship","published":1,"updated":"2021-12-19T10:28:11.179Z","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ckxd3w2ih0000ork23nrb9h8z","content":"<p>By Simina Mistreanu<br>18 December 2021 • 6:00am</p>\n<p>It had been a weekend of celebrations.

2005年大學畢業後，加入北京西部陽光農村發展基金從事農村發展工作，開啟長期關注青少年教育及成長的公益職業生涯。曾擔任西部陽光基金會農村教育項目主管5年。 2014年加入廣州恭明社會組織發展中心，作為青少年成長項目和殘障社群賦能項目主管及統籌，支持和發起相關社區項目工作。 2018年起開始關注職業病工人的權益倡導和服務性工作，提供必要的法律支持。王也是國內#MeToo運動中重要的支持者。\n\n黃雪琴：1988年生，廣東韶關人，獨立記者，曾任《新快報》及《南都周刊》的調查記者，關注性別、平權、官員貪污、企業污染、弱勢群體等議題，也參與多起#MeToo案件的報導和為性侵害性騷擾受害人提供幫助和支持。黃雪琴本計劃於2019年赴香港大學就讀法學碩士，但後於2019年10月17日被廣州警方以“尋釁滋事罪”刑事拘留，後改指定居所監視居住至2020年1月17日取保獲釋。今年秋，成功獲得英國志奮領獎學金支持，原計劃於9月20日前往薩塞克斯大學（University of Sussex）就讀性別與發展學碩士。\n\n「0919雪餅」被捕事件綜述（不斷更新）https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/links/\n\n## 【注意】\n\n本次活動徵集到的照片將用於雪餅案件的聲援和傳播，除此以外我們不會收集其他任何個人資料。","source":"_posts/postcard_event.md","raw":"---\nlayout:

We encourage you to send a postcard to each of them.\nPlease purchase your own stamps for this campaign.\n\n【Cause for Xuebing's arrest】\n\nAccording to friends who were interrogated, the so-called \"subversion\" by the police refers to the friends' gatherings that Wang Jianbing would often host at his home. The theme of the gatherings were merely daily life sharing and companying of depressed communities, with little to no connection to the state or the regime, unless the state considers companionship to be a crime.\n\n【About Xuebing】\n\nWANG Jianbing: Born in 1983 in Tianshui, Gansu Province. Independent activist. He has been involved in non-profit work for over 16 years . His friends prefer to call him “pancake” as his nickname. After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Beijing Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation and ran rural development projects, which kicked off his career as a non-profit worker who cares deeply about the education and development of the youth. He was the project manager of rural education program at Western Sunshine Foundation for 5 years. In 2014, He joined GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development in Guangzhou as the project manager and coordinator of the youth development project as well as the disabled community empowerment project. Since 2018, he has been undertaking rights advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases, such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support for them. Wang also participated in supporting the #MeToo movement in China.\n\nHUANG Xueqin: Born in 1988 in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province. Independent journalist. She worked as an investigative journalist for News Express and Southern Metropolis Weekly. She wrote on topics related to gender, equal rights, government corruption, corporate pollution, and other marginalized groups. She has also participated in many #MeToo cases and campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment cases. Huang Xueqin had planned to go to the University of Hong Kong to enroll in a Master of Laws program in 2019. Her study plan was deferred when she was abruptly detained by the Guangzhou police on October 17th 2019 for the charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. She was later moved to a different location for residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) until she was released under supervision on January 17th, 2020. She had received a full scholarship for her master’s studies from Chevening Scholarship earlier this year. She was planning to leave for the UK to begin her master’s course in Gender and Development at University of Sussex on September 20th.\n\n【Disclaimer】\n\nThe photos collected from this campaign will be used for advocating Xuebing’s case.

After graduating from university in 2005, he joined the Beijing Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation and ran rural development projects, which kicked off his career as a non-profit worker who cares deeply about the education and development of the youth. He was the project manager of rural education program at Western Sunshine Foundation for 5 years. In 2014, He joined GongMing Institute of Social Organization and Development in Guangzhou as the project manager and coordinator of the youth development project as well as the disabled community empowerment project. Since 2018, he has been undertaking rights advocacy and service work for workers with occupational diseases, such as pneumoconiosis, providing necessary legal support for them. Wang also participated in supporting the #MeToo movement in China.\n\nHUANG Xueqin: Born in 1988 in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province. Independent journalist.

She wrote on topics related to gender, equal rights, government corruption, corporate pollution, and other marginalized groups. She has also participated in many #MeToo cases and campaigns to provide support and assistance to victims of sexual assault and harassment cases. Huang Xueqin had planned to go to the University of Hong Kong to enroll in a Master of Laws program in 2019. Her study plan was deferred when she was abruptly detained by the Guangzhou police on October 17th 2019 for the charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. She was later moved to a different location for residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) until she was released under supervision on January 17th, 2020. She had received a full scholarship for her master’s studies from Chevening Scholarship earlier this year. She was planning to leave for the UK to begin her master’s course in Gender and Development at University of Sussex on September 20th.\n\n【Disclaimer】\n\nThe photos collected from this campaign will be used for advocating Xuebing’s case.

Being a journalist is not a crime","date":"2022-01-09T06:24:06.517Z","cover":"https://i.imgur.com/Uk4FwvG.png","_content":"编者注：这是黄雪琴在2019年10月17日第一次被捕时写的狱中笔记，罪名是 \"寻衅滋事罪\"。2021年9月19日，她与工运人士王建兵在广州再次被捕，罪名是 \"煽动颠覆国家政权\"。 她和王建兵至今下落不明。\n\nEditor’s note:\nThis is a prison note written by Huang Xueqin, when she was arrested the first time in 2019.10.17 under the charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. She was arrested again with labor activists Wang Jianbing at Guangzhou in 2021.09.19, under the charge of “inciting subversion of state power”.  She and Wang's whereabout remains unknown.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uk4FwvG.png)\n\n我是黄雪琴（Sophia Huang Xueqin），一个来自中国大陆广州的独立记者。我为自己的身份感到骄傲，即使我因它而入狱。今年夏天，我目睹了香港的抗议活动，我报道了其中在中国大陆被篡改或埋没的新闻和故事，但我的报道后来被审查封禁了。\n\nI am Sophia Huang Xueqin, a(n) independent journalist from Guangzhou, mainland China. I am proud of who I am even it brought me to the cell now. Witnessing the protest in HK this summer, I report the news and stories which are edited or buried in mainland China, but my reporting(s) are censored later.\n\n8月25日，我回到广州时，警察审问了我22个小时，并没收了我所有的旅行证件。我被迫撤回录取通知书，没有办法申请学生签证的情况下，我只好推迟入学港大一年。10月17日，警察要求我去拿我的旅行证件，但当我到达警察局时他们却逮捕了我。警察们把我关在牢房里，指控我犯罪，他们说这是 \"挑起事端和制造混乱\"。他们说，如果我承认罪行，并保证不再写报道反对他们，就可以释放我。我拒绝了，记录和报道是我的义务和责任。我愿意承担我的报道的代价。\n\nThe police interrogated me for 22 hours when I returned Guangzhou at August 25 and confiscated all my travel document(s). I have to withdraw the offer and delay my study for a year in HKU without my permit to apply the student visa. The police asked me to fetch my travel document at October 17, but they arrested me when I arrived at the police station. They keep me in the cell and charging me the crime, which they said is “picking up trouble and making chaos”(“Picking quarrels and provoking trouble”). They said I can be released if I confess the crime and promise never write against them again. I refuse(d). It is my obligation and duty to record and report.

‘Ordinary Chinese Activist’","date":"2022-01-27T02:39:44.293Z","cover":"https://i.imgur.com/VZidzeJ.png","_content":"I first met Jianbing on a cold Gansu winter day over twelve years ago, in the Year of the Ox. As fate would have it, the same astrological sign that brought a dear friend into my life snatched him away mercilessly when it returned twelve years later.\n\nI remember that day as if it were yesterday. Jianbing was getting up from a bunk bed in the hostel dormitory where we were both staying at the time. He was intrigued by this foreigner arriving with a Beijing colleague, and was relieved to learn that said foreigner could speak enough Mandarin to communicate with those around him.\n\nJianbing was born in rural Gansu. The first in his family to get a college degree, he made the brave choice to work at a non-profit, the Beijing Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation, instead of landing a more secure and well-paid job in an average urban company. He joined the foundation’s kindergarten program so that he could help kids from rural areas access a better education than the one he had himself.\n\nHe is a soft-spoken and highly reflective person who always knows how to make people comfortable through simple gestures and glances. I’ve always admired his open-mindedness, his ability to listen and ponder things before making any judgment. Unlike many of the other Chinese activists I have met over the years, Jianbing is fond of Chinese classical culture, and while he was at university, he taught himself to sing several different provincial styles of Chinese opera just from listening to them online. It wasn’t uncommon for him to start singing an opera or reciting a Tang poem while walking the streets of Beijing or Lanzhou, ignoring the bewildered looks of passers-by.\n\nAfter our encounter in Gansu, life sent us on different paths for a few years, but we kept in touch through common friends. When we met again, it was in a different China. General Secretary Xi Jinping had replaced Hu Jintao. Many activists had been jailed. NGOs and intellectuals once praised by the regime were shut down and censored. But Jianbing was still himself, slightly more pessimistic, but calm and convinced that China needed people to tell the stories of sick migrant workers, oppressed women, and traumatized activists.\n\nHe did not deny the real material progress China has made, a progress he could very well see in his hometown, where kids had food to eat, clothes to wear, and toys to play with—a far cry from his own childhood.

When we met again, it was in a different China. General Secretary Xi Jinping had replaced Hu Jintao. Many activists had been jailed.

Open Letter to the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom in Support of HUANG Xueqin, a #Metoo Activist and Independent Journalist from China by Feminist Scholars Based in the UK\n\nDear Mr.Zheng Zeguang, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom,\n\nI have the honour of delivering this open letter on behalf of 55 feminists based in the UK.\n\nWe are gravely concerned about the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of HUANG Xueqin. HUANG Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who had planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in September 2021. She is a leading #MeToo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China, whose inspiring life story is recorded in the article ‘Huang Xueqin: How could a journalist keep silent?’. [1]\n\nInternational media has reported that HUANG Xueqin, together with her friend WANG Jianbing, a labour rights activist and #MeToo supporter, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China on 19 September 2021.[2] This occurred one day before Xueqin’s departure to take up her scholarship in the UK. Both remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared. A group of volunteers set up a website to update their situation. [3]\n \nWe express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chinese feminist, Xueqin. This arrest seems to be only aimed at punishing her for her human rights activism. Such an act of repression is utterly shocking and unacceptable. \n\nAs feminists based in the UK, we deeply appreciate Xueqin’s great contributions to both the Chinese and international #MeToo movement. We have been anticipating Xueqin’s arrival to UK to share her experiences and knowledge in feminist activism and journalism. It is disappointing that the University of Sussex and Chevening Scholarship have not released any public statement regarding the situation of Xueqin. We believe that her endeavours to promote awareness of sexual harassment and the need for gender equality should be honoured and remembered rather than being censored.\n\nWe stand in solidarity with our feminist sister: HUANG Xueqin. In the knowledge that it is extremely politically high-risk for Chinese feminists to openly voice their concern, we speak out as an international feminist community and hope feminists in the UK can join us to call for Xueqin and Jianbing’s release. We invite anyone who is deeply concerned with feminism, labour rights issues and civil society in China to sign this open letter.\n\nWe strongly urge Chinese authorities to disclose the whereabouts of HUANG Xueqin and WANG Jianbing and release them immediately and unconditionally.\n\nCOSIGNATORIES (This list is arranged according to alphabetical order)\n\n    1.

HUANG Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who had planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in September 2021. She is a leading #MeToo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China, whose inspiring life story is recorded in the article ‘Huang Xueqin: How could a journalist keep silent?’. [1]</p>\n<p>International media has reported that HUANG Xueqin, together with her friend WANG Jianbing, a labour rights activist and #MeToo supporter, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China on 19 September 2021.[2] This occurred one day before Xueqin’s departure to take up her scholarship in the UK. Both remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared. A group of volunteers set up a website to update their situation. [3]</p>\n<p>We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chinese feminist, Xueqin. This arrest seems to be only aimed at punishing her for her human rights activism. Such an act of repression is utterly shocking and unacceptable. </p>\n<p>As feminists based in the UK, we deeply appreciate Xueqin’s great contributions to both the Chinese and international #MeToo movement. We have been anticipating Xueqin’s arrival to UK to share her experiences and knowledge in feminist activism and journalism. It is disappointing that the University of Sussex and Chevening Scholarship have not released any public statement regarding the situation of Xueqin. We believe that her endeavours to promote awareness of sexual harassment and the need for gender equality should be honoured and remembered rather than being censored.</p>\n<p>We stand in solidarity with our feminist sister: HUANG Xueqin. In the knowledge that it is extremely politically high-risk for Chinese feminists to openly voice their concern, we speak out as an international feminist community and hope feminists in the UK can join us to call for Xueqin and Jianbing’s release. We invite anyone who is deeply concerned with feminism, labour rights issues and civil society in China to sign this open letter.</p>\n<p>We strongly urge Chinese authorities to disclose the whereabouts of HUANG Xueqin and WANG Jianbing and release them immediately and unconditionally.</p>\n<p>COSIGNATORIES (This list is arranged according to alphabetical order)</p>\n<pre><code>1.

src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DcHUbG3.png\"></p>\n<p>你们走得匆忙，未来得及留下只言片语，我们已然隔着高墙和层层铁门。当暗夜降临时，我们几乎没有察觉。没有人见证那个夜晚，但所有人都看到了涌动的暗潮，赤裸而袒露。在你们挣扎着从旧日的废墟中慢慢建立起一个新的世界时，魔鬼在门口伺机而动：他们手握铁锤，戴上面具，鱼贯而入。</p>\n<p>这样荒谬诡谲的事件发生之时竟然没有一丝神秘可言，它切切实实地公开发生了。我的朋友，那个晚上，发生了什么？魔鬼将你们带往何处？你们经历了什么样的搏斗和厮杀？我们这些所谓的逃跑的“幸存者”，也不过是在灾难降临之后勉强找到这场密谋已久的“凶杀”的蛛丝马迹：监控摄像头、监听设备、秘密警察以及一顶白色高帽。</p>\n<p>你们离开以后，一场黑色风暴随之降临，混乱、焦虑、恐慌、愤怒、绝望席卷了风暴中的人们。魔鬼守候在街角，等待时机敲开一个个家门，他们依旧手握铁锤，带上面具，鱼贯而入。黑压压的一片，看不清来路，也看不到去路。村里有人连夜消失了，有人逃往更远的乡下，还有人干脆卷铺走人漂泊四海。有的人去了又回来了，有的人离开了，没有音讯。一些奇怪的事情发生了：有人被带到黑不见光的屋子里，啥也看不到，被要求签下自己的名字，可是他们什么也看不到，怎么写名字啊？还有的人接到奇怪的陌生电话，另一边嘟嘟作响，啥也不说。</p>\n<p>他们带着审判者的面具，精心布置一场凶杀，好指认一个个凶手。凶案的制造者生产着凶手，似乎如果没有凶手的一天，他们就无处谋生。为了活下去，他们要制造一个个凶神恶煞的敌人。</p>\n<p>这一切都并不新鲜。发生在你们身上的、发生在村里的，很多年前开始就一直发生了，也即将发生在更多的人身上。侥幸的恐惧是幸存者的宿命，魔鬼随时守候。</p>\n<p>我们同样感到愤怒和悲伤，但丢出去的石子就像轻飘飘的稻草般没有任何声响，很快汹涌的暗潮卷起，吞没。“只有不义却没有对它的抵抗”，不义的愤怒最终也只剩下无力抵抗的绝望；合理的憎恶让我们在逼仄的角落挥舞打不出去的拳头，让脾气变坏；理据充分的控诉也只会让自己的声音格外刺耳，引人恼烦。我们也必须伪装起来，伪装日子照常，伪装着生活继续，伪装着快步往前。仿佛一种体系性的力量，将我们拽入暗箱，如同把你们生生拽入一样——记忆在一个世界里抹除，声音在一个世界里没有回音，而生活其中的我们，也学会了伪装：“这种伪装从体制而来，生活其中的人们，被它重重包裹”。</p>\n<p>一起生活、一起行动都意味着罪化的可能，他们恐惧“关系”，在我们之间形成的“世界”。我们纷纷从外部世界中撤离，躲进自己的世界里，企图保障自我边界的安全和稳定。但绝望的“自保”策略某一程度上也带来了孤绝。我们只能依靠个人微弱的力量支撑着走进暗夜。可以确认的是，我们依旧没有忘记你们。恐惧不安会让我们放弃对公共世界的信任和投入，伤痛也让我们彼此血脉相连，你们时不时进入我们的梦里来：一起散步、一起吃饭、一起晒太阳。</p>\n<p>如何面对一直是作为幸存者的课题。我总是徘徊于表达的焦虑不安和不表达的愧疚之中。我们既要假装正常，又无法抹除根植于生命中的经验和遭遇——那些魔鬼闯荡的夜晚。这些，也一直是我从高墙的另一边走来之后所面临的抉择。我一直很好奇，人们都是怎么面对这样的困境。大概是50多年前，汉娜·阿伦特在思考二战中犹太人的处境时就追问从世界撤离的人们是有依旧应对世界抱有责任，她认为即使我们都热烈地渴望躲藏到自身灵魂逃避世界，但如果彻底抛弃现实性，就是一种人性的丧失：</p>\n<p> “如果在第三帝国，一位日耳曼人和一位犹太人结下友谊时仅仅声称’我们都是人类’，这句话就很难作为一种人性的标记。它只是对那一时代他们共同的现实和世界的逃避，他们也并非是在反抗那个世界。那些试图否认日耳曼人和犹太人差别的人们，或许可以规避那部禁止这两类人进行交流的法案，但他们却不可能反抗它。如果要保持一种尚未丧失其现实根基、处于迫害之现实中的人性，他们必须能够对彼此说：’一个日耳曼人和一个犹太人，成为朋友’”</p>\n<p>因此，借用这个逻辑，我要能够说：</p>\n<p>“我的两位朋友，一位记者和一位关心工人的公益人，他们因为聚会已经失去自由152天了”。</p>\n<p><img

src=\"https://i.imgur.com/daKyJAs.png\"></p>\n<p>今年一月，我们在英国的中国女权社群在户外举办声援雪饼的野餐活动。雪琴是女权记者，建兵也积极参与过国内的 metoo 运动，我们女权主义者很能感受到和他们之间的精神联结。况且建兵曾经在英国生活过一年，雪琴也拿到了志奋领奖学金，在来伦敦上学前夕无端被捕。我们想要代替他们在这里出现，和社群里的朋友讨论雪饼事件，谈谈中国政府和女权主义的关系，也做一些相关的艺术创作。英国的一家主流媒体(以下简称 M)事先联系了我们，说希望可以来记录这次活动，并做几组访问。</p>\n<p>然而，M 的工作人员其实并没有耐心等我们办活动，也不打算只是在一旁记录。刚见面他们就抢过了主导权，开始指挥我们摆拍。我们不再是为声援雪饼野餐，而是在表演为声援雪饼野餐。镜头之下，我们没有空间和社群里的朋友产生真实的互动。当我们提出质疑时，他们却说，如果我们不配合他们的套路，拍出来的影片可能会“不好看”，吸引不到观众，也就没办法在舆论上帮助雪饼了。我们只好照做。</p>\n<p>在访问时，他们要求我们用尽可能简短的句子，清晰而大声地回答。问题也带有明显的引导性质：你认为中国的审查环境是什么样的？换句话说，为什么你们在英国办这次活动？再换句话说，你们在中国为什么不能办这样的抗议活动？于是，在这个寒冷的清晨，我和朋友像刚刚得救的难民一样，冻得瑟瑟发抖地坐在箱子上，举着雪饼的头像挡住脸，对着俯拍镜头，一字一顿地大声朗诵：“中国的审查环境非常严苛，不允许有抗议活动……”</p>\n<p>除此之外，工作人员还问了另一些同样空泛的问题。由于没有得到必要的说明，我们不知道这些问题的目的是什么，为什么会在毫无关联的主题之间横跳。我们的回答会如何剪辑，亦无从得知。</p>\n<p>无论是这些提问还是整个拍摄流程，都显示出 M 这样的主流媒体和我们之间的权力不对等。他们的霸权，体现在他们可以塑造和传播某一种叙事，去迎合和教育他们庞大的受众。这一种叙事里包括恐怖邪恶的威权政府，包括被压迫的雪饼，甚至包括有责任和能力帮助他们的英国社会；但就是不包括雪饼做了什么、说了什么，如何热爱和保护过他们关注的群体。在这种叙事中，行动者自己的主体性被完全忽略了。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DPvBB1B.png\"></p>\n<p>若在中国的审查环境下，民众只是一群敢怒而不敢言、匍匐着瑟瑟发抖的受害者，只有到了英国才能“反抗”，那么中国政府又为何要在审查上不断加码，让行动者们平白失踪呢？</p>\n<p>并不是只有集会或游行才算反抗。无论是非暴力不合作的“躺平”，还是《哪有记者不发声》，都是值得关注的形式。当英国媒体戴着怜悯的滤镜，消费我们的苦难时，他们有意无意地忽视了在不同政治环境下，行动的多种多样。正是与“民主社会”不同的这些行动方式，体现着中国行动者独特的经验、智慧和创造力。</p>\n<p>当英国媒体猎奇地将中国政府塑造成一个巨大的独裁机器，强调它和“民主国家”之间的差别，让民众高枕无忧地活在自由的绮梦中时，英国政府亦提出了 anti protest 法案。殷鉴不远。</p>\n<p>和 M 的接触让我们意识到，无论身处何处，我们都不应该依赖建制化的政府和媒体。相比之下，也许雪饼的方式才是更值得我们尊重和学习的——关注和帮助具体的人，在去中心化的平台上独立发声，更灵活地应对不同的环境。</p>\n<p>Be water, my friend.</p>\n<p><img

Huang was due to start a master’s program at the University of Sussex as a Chevening Scholar. They have both been charged with incitement to subvert state power, a nebulous charge which has long been used against activists and civil society members.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/I9pl5Mf.jpg\"></p>\n<p>For months, the pair’s whereabouts remained unclear until 5 November 2021, when Wang’s family members received a letter stating that he was being held at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. On 25 January 2022, it was revealed that Huang was being held at Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center. However, it is impossible to confirm if the pair are being held at those detention centers because their friends and family have not been able to send them money via the prison’s system. </p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing are only the two of the most recent examples of this heavy handed approach to policing civil society. <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/people/sophia-huang-xueqin/\">Huang</a> is an award-winning journalist and prominent #MeToo campaigner who used her journalistic talents to report on the movement. Huang reported on the first major #MeToo case in China but also took on an activist and promotional role by starting a fund for victims. Wang is a committee member of that fund.</p>\n<p>As a freelance journalist, Huang has also been targeted by authorities for reporting on protests in Hong Kong’s 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill movement. In a <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/01/09/being-a-journalist-is-not-a-crime/\">prison note</a> from 2019, when she was arrested for her reporting on Hong Kong, Huang wrote about her pride in being a journalist and her pride in her work reporting on protests in Hong Kong–news of which is swiftly buried on the mainland. <a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/wang-jianbing-guangzhou-gongmin-ngo/\">Wang</a> is a labor activist and NGO worker providing legal support to workers with occupational diseases who has also been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement and <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/01/27/ordinary_chinese_activist/\">the marginalized in society</a>. </p>\n<p>What does it mean to “subvert state power” today? The pair were charged with subversion presumably for hosting group gatherings in their homes, where concerned citizens could gather. It seems, therefore, that this has become a crime. One thing is clear: the pair’s detention has further underscored that the CCP today is no friend to feminists or independent labor organisers. Years before China’s <a href=\"https://signal.supchina.com/chinas-metoo-movement-explained/\">#MeToo movement was censored and then co-opted</a> by the state apparatus, the Chinese state <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/china-feminist-five\">jailed five feminist activists</a> for protesting against sexual harassment on public transport. Morever, supporting <a href=\"https://libcom.org/history/chinas-migrant-workers\">internal migrant workers</a> (<em>nongminggong</em>), who suffer under a discriminatory housing registration scheme (<em>hukou</em>) or marginalised groups like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/08/outrage-over-crackdown-on-lgbtq-wechat-accounts-in-china\">LGBTQ</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1001285/invisible-millions-chinas-unnoticed-disabled-people\">disabled</a> people, and even <a href=\"https://clb.org.hk/content/trade-union-officials-distance-themselves-food-delivery-workers%E2%80%99-suffering\">gig workers</a>, is also taken as a threat to the status quo. Official union federations, which are not independent and are instead embedded into the party bureaucracy do not offer support to these groups, who are left with few options. Citizens, like Huang and Wang, who feel called to act to remedy the injustices they see–whether against women, LGBTQ people, disabled people or downtrodden workers–act bravely, risking the ire of a colossal state security apparatus. </p>\n<p>The space for criticism of prevailing anti-worker and anti-feminist attitudes in the PRC has narrowed greatly in the years since Xi Jinping’s presidency began in 2013. Public activism and awareness raising therefore happens often, though not exclusively, outside the mainland of the PRC. A group of friends of Huang and Wang have organised a <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/11/55_scholars_support/\">letter of solidarity</a> from 55 feminist scholars in the UK, calling for their release. Demonstrations have been held in <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/20/%E5%9C%A8%E8%87%BA%E5%8C%97%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E5%80%91%E6%92%90%E9%9B%AA%E9%A4%85%EF%BC%81/\">Taipei</a>, <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/05/xuebing_world/\">Hong Kong and London</a>, and supporters have sent them <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeXueBing/status/1493052625822130183\">postcards</a> while they remain in detention.

She has worked to promote women’s rights, and to document and expose sexual harassment against women and girls in the workplace and in educational institutions.

Wang Jianbing’s family visited multiple police offices in Guangzhou in an attempt to locate him, without success. They then submitted complaints to the district, municipal and provincial public security offices without receiving any meaningful response. When the family submitted complaints against the police to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate, on 30 September 2021, the office refused to intervene. Also, the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau has so far rejected twice, in October and November, Wang Jianbing’s lawyer’s requests to meet with the human rights defender and to have him released on bail.\n\nOn 30 September 2021, three unidentified persons, suspected to be state security officers, summoned Wang Jianbing’s family for interrogation at a police station without showing any official identification or warrants.

more -->\n\n## （1）回顾“雪饼”被捕的半年\n\n两人被捕羁押情形如同黑洞。自2021年9月19日两人被强迫失踪后，雪饼的家人和朋友只能通过被传唤的朋友间接了解警方对两人的非法控罪和意图，警方也并未给家属寄送法律规定的拘留通知书。直至家属收到“逮捕通知书”后，才真正确认两人的罪名——“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”，以及关押地点——广州市第一看守所。但是，2021年1月底我们才获知黄雪琴实际羁押于广州市第二看守所，而王建兵是否真的关押在第一看守所则无从得知。雪饼家人和朋友半年来多次尝试给看守所中的雪饼两人汇款，均显示失败，暗示两人的关押地点可能与实际不符或者被化名关押。雪饼两人真实的关押地点、身体健康等基本情况，我们迄今无从得知。\n\n迄今约70位雪饼朋友被警方持续传唤审讯。自雪饼被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地公安部门，持续开始了本地或跨地区传唤或审讯，迄今已有大约70位雪饼朋友或家庭聚会参与者被传唤做笔录。广州警察没有出示任何合法手续即对他/她们进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓，且强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。警方强迫和威胁部分雪饼朋友签署由警方编造的虚假口供，要求他们指认雪饼两人曾参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，以及将建兵家中的聚会捏造为批评政府的政治性聚会。过去半年间，警方试图以这样的方式来罗织用于指控雪饼的非法证据。\n\n雪饼两人律师会见申请均被拒绝。雪饼两人现均有由双方家属正式聘请的律师。然而自2021年10月以来，王建兵的代理律师萧云阳多次提交给广州警方的会见和取保候审申请均以“涉及国家安全”为由遭拒绝，甚至还曾被怀疑代理资格。近日，黄雪琴代理律师于2022年3月的会见申请也不被准许。\n\n## （2）抓捕“雪饼”是对中国公民社会网络的深化打压\n\n自2015年以来，中国政府加速收紧公民社会活动空间，关注女性和劳工权益等民间组织和行动者陆续遭遇打压和刑事控罪。继2015年“女权五姐妹”案、“709”人权律师案、“123”劳工案、2018年“佳士”工人学生运动等大规模的政治抓捕之后，公民社会网络已渐趋于原子化和碎片化，恐惧危机笼罩在每一个行动者身上。在这样绝望和低沉的社会氛围之下，雪饼两人在自家召集聚会，试图陪伴和鼓励这些失落和无助的、关心社会的行动者。然而，这极为日常的每周聚会，却被政府视为重大的所谓“国家安全”威胁，雪饼两人被以“煽动颠覆国家政权”的重罪来追究。\n\n广州警方在此案中屡以国安为由违法打压公民社会。1) 当局视王建兵家中聚会为危及国家安全的”活动“，实则是对于公民言论自由、结社自由等的侵犯，更何况该聚会并非以谈论政治为主题，而是青年人社群互助和陪伴的日常网络。2) 对雪饼的打压，同样是对当下中国公民社会中“残留”的民间网络，尤其是性别和劳工议题行动者的进一步打压——性别议题在#MeToo运动和彭帅事件之后已被严重政治化，而针对工人群体的关注和支援多年来被视为影响社会稳定的核心因素之一。3) 雪饼被抓之后，警方以涉及“国家安全”为由拒绝向外界披露任何有关两人的信息，警方更曾私下透露两人被单独关押，涉嫌滥用指定居所监视居住（RSDL）；警方也以“国家安全”为由拒绝律师会见，剥夺两人的合法权利和公众知情权。\n\n雪饼两人的政治遭遇正是政府对公民社会网络的深化打压的缩影。在对组织化的民间团体进行彻底打压和关闭之后，政府试图进一步摧毁残留的行动者网络，也将国家机器转向更为低调和不知名的行动者，营造恐慌的氛围。这对于社会发展和政治自由绝对是更为致命性的影响，就如因新冠去世的“吹哨人”李文亮医生所说，“健康的社会不应只有一种声音” ——对雪饼的打压正在令呼吁社会正义的声音逐渐消匿。\n\n## （3）警方“延期侦查”即将到期\n\n根据《刑事诉讼法》，针对预期刑期十年以下的案件，警方侦查羁押期限最长可以延至五个月，到期后需将案件起诉意见书、案卷材料、证据等移送检察院（第154、156、157条）。雪饼两人于2021年10月27日被正式批捕，迄今已经被连续延长侦查期两次，至2022年3月27日警方的“侦查期”将正式满五个月。我们无法得知警方是否会依照正常程序将雪饼在3月27日前侦查终结并移送，又或许警方会继续采用拖延政策，“套用”其他条款继续向检察院申请延长侦查期限。我们将严肃关注！\n\n## （4）声援“雪饼”，来自全球各地的声音\n\n尽管政府正在持续打压公民社会，通过传唤胁迫等方式令更多的行动者噤声，甚至强化网络审查令声援雪饼的行动和资讯都无法流通传播，但是诸多的伙伴和组织都在持续关注和支持雪饼：除了国际媒体和人权机构的声援外，我们在半年间也收到了大量国内外朋友以联署、明信片、面具照等形式表达对于雪饼的支持。简要列举如下：\t\n1. 雪饼被强迫失踪和任意羁押后，[Amnesty

在联合国人权理事会中发言，呼吁人权高专办（OHCHR）关注雪饼事件，要求中国政府释放两人。\n2. 在英国，55名[女权学者](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/11/55_scholars_support/)和[英国大学及学院工会（UCU）](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWshZFjBN5Qyn9TCEaRDS2HfTZV2o6JPWAA-vFjb1VVCemtg/viewform)的83位成员发起并参与了联署，要求中国政府立即释放雪饼；[112名志奋领学者（Chevenor）](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/12/07/statement1208/)发表联合声明，对雪饼两人遭遇任意羁押、无法探视的处境表示严切关注，督促英国外交部FCDO和旗下志奋领委员会对此事发声。\n3. 世界各地有近百位朋友给雪饼[寄送明信片](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/12/26/postcard_event/)，表达对雪饼的关心祝福和对警察滥捕的抗议。另外，伦敦、香港、台北、阿联酋等地有支持者[戴着雪饼的面具](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/05/xuebing_world/)，在城市各处进行拍照抗议，呼吁中国政府释放雪饼。\n\n这些行动展现出雪饼案所引起的广泛愤怒和不满。作为熟悉雪饼的朋友，我们始终认为所有的外界声援行动，都会对警方的行为产生警告作用，将有助于改善雪饼两人的关押处境。长远来看，我们呼吁更多国内、国外的团体和个人加入声援雪饼的行动，争取两人的自由。\n\n## （5）来自“雪饼”朋友的呼吁\n\n雪饼两人与我们已经整整失联六个月了，我们完全无法想象她们正在遭遇什么样的酷刑和羞辱，朋友和家人一直都在深切担心着她们的身心健康。但是我们相信，雪饼一定还在坚持信念，身为记者不是一个罪，参与#MeToo不是一个罪，支持工人不是一个罪，关注社会公义从来都不应该是一个罪！\n\n作为雪饼的朋友：\n- 我们严厉谴责广州警方和政府对雪饼两人的肆意抓捕和控罪，我们要求政府立即披露两人的关押地点和身心健康情况，允许两人的律师会见，并无条件释放黄雪琴和王建兵！\n- 我们对于英国志奋领奖学金（Chevening）委员会和英国萨塞克斯大学（University of Sussex）在其附属学者/学生黄雪琴被强迫失踪和任意逮捕期间的持续沉默表示深切的失望。我们呼吁志奋领奖学金委员会和大学官方积极回应和谴责中国政府打压人权捍卫者的恶劣行为。\n- 我们感激国际公益组织、人权机构、社会媒体和国际公民社会对于雪饼两人的声援和帮助，她们也将感激大家对于中国人权状况的的持续关注。我们呼吁更多的国际团体继续关注和支持深受打压的中国人权捍卫者。\n- 我们希望所有受到影响的雪饼的朋友和公民社会的伙伴能够保持坚强。政治的打压会让我们深陷恐惧，只有共同团结和彼此陪伴才能让我们保持力量和自由，这也是雪饼一直以来在努力的事情。\n\n释放雪饼！\n\n雪饼的朋友 Friends of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing  \n2022年3月20日\n\n\n关注雪饼案最新动态：

雪饼被抓之后，警方以涉及“国家安全”为由拒绝向外界披露任何有关两人的信息，警方更曾私下透露两人被单独关押，涉嫌滥用指定居所监视居住（RSDL）；警方也以“国家安全”为由拒绝律师会见，剥夺两人的合法权利和公众知情权。</p>\n<p>雪饼两人的政治遭遇正是政府对公民社会网络的深化打压的缩影。在对组织化的民间团体进行彻底打压和关闭之后，政府试图进一步摧毁残留的行动者网络，也将国家机器转向更为低调和不知名的行动者，营造恐慌的氛围。这对于社会发展和政治自由绝对是更为致命性的影响，就如因新冠去世的“吹哨人”李文亮医生所说，“健康的社会不应只有一种声音” ——对雪饼的打压正在令呼吁社会正义的声音逐渐消匿。</p>\n<h2

They were immediately placed under Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location (RSDL) and it was not until early November 2021 that their family members received formal \"arrest notices\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau.\n\nDespite such notices stating they would be detained in Guangzhou, up until today no family member or lawyer has been able to effectively meet or talk to them, leaving their whereabouts effectively unknown and constituting an incommunicado detention.\n\nOn April 1, the Free Xueqin & Jianbing 释放雪饼 campaign announced they had been transferred to Guangzhou City Procuratorate for review and prosecution. Citing national security grounds, their lawyers have still not been granted access to meet them.\n\nSince their arrest, about 70 of Xueqin’s friends and fellow feminists have been continuously summoned, intimidated and interrogated by the police, and forced to sign false confessions alleging the two of having partaken in so-called training activities to “subvert state power”.\n\nWhile Peng Shuai’s disappearance from public view and coerced statements following her accusations of sexual abuse by Zhang Gaoli have rightfully raised concern across the globe, the continuous crackdown on rights activists and feminists within the People’s Republic of China remains a little-known issue. We therefore publish a summary overview of their case on the basis of a translation of the appeal made by the Free Xueqin & Jianbing 释放雪饼 campaign on March 20, 2022.\n\n## Arrest and disappearance\n\nHuang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were both taken on September 19, 2021, one day before Xueqin was expected to travel to the UK under a scholarship at the University of Sussex with the UK Chevening Committee. They were initially disappeared into a regime favorite for human rights defenders: Residential Surveillance at a Designated.\n\nOnly through the continuous police summons and questioning of fellow activists did Xuebing's family and friends learn about the police's charges and intentions against the two, as despite legal provisions no detention notice was sent until October 27, 2021, when the two were officially charged with “inciting subversion of state power” and said to be detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center.\n\n![](https://safeguarddefenders.com/sites/default/files/1500x500.jpg)\n\nHowever, at the end of January 2021, it was learned that Huang Xueqin was actually being detained in the Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center, and whether Wang Jianbing was actually being detained in the No. 1 Detention Center remains unknown. Xueqin's family and friends have tried several times over the past six months to send money to Xueqin and Jianbing in the detention center, but to no avail. This strongly suggests that the place of their detention may not match the location provided or that they were detained under pseudonyms as denounced in our report Access Denied – China’s Vanishing Suspects. Family, friends and lawyers have no way of knowing the actual detention location and physical health of the two of them.\n\nWhile Xueqin and Jianbing both have lawyers appointed by their families, none of them have been able to meet with their clients. Since October 2021, Jianbing’s lawyer Xiao Yunyang has repeatedly submitted applications to the Guangzhou police for interviews and bail pending trial applications, all of which have been rejected on the grounds of “national security”. More recently, Xueqin's lawyer's application for a meeting in March 2022 was also rejected. This increasing practice has been amply documented in our report China’s Legal Blockade.\n\nMeanwhile, about 70 of Xueqin’s friends have been continuously summoned by the police for interrogation. Since her arrest, the Guangzhou police in conjunction with public security departments across the country, have continued to issue local or cross-regional subpoenas for interrogations. Without respect for any legal formalities, the Guangzhou police interrogated and intimidated them for up to 24 hours, and forcibly searched and copied their electronic equipment. The police forced and threatened some of Xueqin’s friends to sign false confessions fabricated by the police, asking them to allege that the two had participated in so-called training activities of a “subverting state power” and defining the gathering at Jianbing’s home as a political criticism of the government. reunion. Over the past six months, the police have relentlessly tried to collect illegal evidence to accuse Xueqin in this way. \n\n## A long history of repression\n\nSince 2015, the Chinese government has accelerated its crackdown on civil society, with repressive policies and charges against civil organizations and activists concerned with women's and labor rights. The precise aim of large-scale political arrests such as the \"Feminist Five\" case in 2015, the \"709\" crackdown on human rights lawyer, or the \"123\" suppression of labor activists was to gradually disintegrate civil society networks and instill widespread fear in the community.  \n\nIt was in this depressing atmosphere that Xueqin and Jianbing convened a party at his home, as to accompany and encourage those feeling lost in the increasingly oppressive environment. However, this weekly gathering is now regarded by the government as a major so-called \"national security\" threat, leading to the charges of  \"inciting subversion of state power\" against the two.\n\nAfter the complete crackdown and shutdown of organized civil society, it is evident the government seeks to further dismantle the remaining network of actors, all while shifting the state apparatus’ attention to more low-profile and unknown actors, further adding to the atmosphere of panic in what little of the community has managed to survive.\n\nFurthermore, as the case of Peng Shuai and the suppression of the Me Too movement demonstrate, women’s rights movements are regarded and treated as an existential threat to the survival of the CCP and routinely accused of colluding with foreign forces. In fact, on April 1st, a WeChat account linked to CCP mouthpiece the Global Times published a smear piece against other Chinese feminist activists and Safeguard Defenders’ Director Peter Dahlin.\n\n## An appeal by friends\n\nIt has been six months since we lost contact with Xueqin. We cannot imagine the torture and humiliation she is going through. Friends and family have been deeply worried about her physical and mental health. But we believe that Xueqin must hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a sin, participating in #MeToo is not a sin, supporting workers is not a sin, and paying attention to social justice should never be a sin!\n\n \n\nAs friends:\n\nWe strongly condemn the arbitrary arrest and charges against Xueqin by the Guangzhou police and the government. We demand that the government immediately discloses the place of detention,  information on the physical and mental health of the two, allows their lawyers to meet, and releases Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing unconditionally!\n\nWe are deeply disappointed by the continued silence by the UK Chevening Committee and the University of Sussex during the enforced disappearance and arbitrary arrest of its affiliated scholar/student Xueqin Huang. We call on the Chevening Scholarship Committee and university officials to actively respond to and condemn the Chinese government's egregious repression of human rights defenders.\nWe are grateful to international non-profit organizations, human rights organizations, social media and international civil society for their solidarity and help to Xueqin, as well as everyone's continued attention to the human rights situation in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.\nWe hope all our friends and partners in civil society who have been affected by this crackdown will remain strong. Political repression makes us deeply fearful, and only the unity and company of each other can keep us strong and free.

For the last few years, Mr. Wang has worked for an NGO championing equitable treatment for people with disabilities and in 2018 turned his attention to supporting the cause of workers with occupational diseases. He has also been an outspoken advocate of the #metoo campaign in China.**\n\nMr. Yang Maodong, commonly known by his pen-name Guo Feixiong, is a veteran human rights defender who has been the subject of eight urgent appeals and allegation letters sent to your Excellency's Government; on 6 March 2006; on 19 October 2006; on 1 December 2006; on 30 November 2007 and on 22 October 2013 respectively (CHN 12/2013), 7 August 2015 (CHN 8/2015), 23 December 2015 (CHN 13/2015), 3 June 2016 (CHN 4/2016) and 20 July 2016 (CHN 6/2016). \n\nHe has served a total of 11 years in prison since 2007. In 2019, he was released following the completion of a six-year sentence for “gathering crowds to disturb social order” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. \n\nMr. Tang Jitian is a human rights lawyer who was disbarred in 2010, allegedly as a result of his taking on of human rights cases. He was the subject of four previous communications sent to your Excellency’s Government, dated 7 November 2008, see A/HRC/10/12/Add.1, para. 586- 591, 10 June 2009, see A/HRC/13/22/Add.1, para. 345-352, 27 April 2010, see A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, para. 388-392, and 428-465 and 16 July 2014 (CHN 7/2014).\n\nWe would further like to follow up on cases raised in a communication sent to your Excellency’s government dated 28 April 2021 (CHN 4/2021), namely those of Mr. Qin Yongpei, Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheng. We thank your Excellency's Government for its response, dated 26 June 2021, and note that it stated, “Information on the cases mentioned in the letter will be provided subsequently”. We regret that this information has not yet been received and use this opportunity to seek further clarification. Furthermore, during its 91st session in September 2021, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding the detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi to be arbitrary (A/HRC/WGAD/2021/30). \n\nAccording to the information received: \n\n### The case of Mr. Wang Jianbing \n\n**Mr. Wang Jianbing was detained by police officers from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at his home on 19 September 2021, in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance (i.e. deprived of his liberty and this was followed by a denial of such deprivation and the concealment of his fate and whereabouts). His residence was also searched and a number of personal items were confiscated. It is believed that Mr. Wang Jianbing was detained as a result of his holding a number of private gatherings at his residence in the preceding months. In the aftermath of his arrest, a number of his acquaintances were questioned as to who had attended the meetings, and were allegedly pressured to testify that the meetings were of a political nature, and to sign a document stating that Mr. Wang Jianbing had participated in meetings which “subvert State power”.** \n\nA formal arrest notice dated 27 October 2021 (i.e. more than one month after the actual deprivation of liberty took place) was received by Mr. Wang Jianbing’s family stating that the human rights defender had been arrested on suspicion of “inciting subversion of State power” and is being held in Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre, although his case has not yet been sent to the prosecutor. Prior to their receipt of this notice, Mr. Wang Jianbing’s family had not received any legal documentation as to his status, his whereabouts or the charges he was facing. Neither Mr. Wang Jianbing’s lawyer nor his family have been permitted access to visit him since his detention on 19 September 2021 to confirm his whereabouts. \n\n### The case of Mr. Yang Maodong (Guo Feixiong) \n\nMr. Yang Maodong was forcibly disappeared on 5 December 2021 and family or friends did not receive any information as to his fate and whereabouts until 12 January 2022, when the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a notification to his family that he had been formally arrested. He has reportedly been charged with “inciting subversion of State power” under article 105(2) of China’s Criminal Law, and is being held in Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre. Neither Mr. Yang Maodong’s lawyer nor his family have been permitted access to visit him since his detention to confirm his whereabouts. Prior to his enforced disappearance, Mr. Yang Maodong had been prevented from leaving China to travel to the USA to be with his wife, Ms. Zhang Qing, who was suffering from late stage bowel cancer. On 29 November 2021, Mr. Yang Maodong wrote an open letter to Premier Li Keqiang asking him to investigate why the Ministry for Public Security was continuing to block his application to go abroad. Ms. Zhang Qing died on 10 January 2022. \n\n### The case of Mr. Tang Jitian \n\nThe fate and whereabouts of Mr. Tang Jitian have been unknown since 10 December 2021 and there are legitimate fears that he is detained by authorities. He was due to attend an event hosted by the European Union Delegation in Beijing on 10 December to mark Human Rights Day, but he did not appear at the event and friends and family were not able to contact him for several weeks thereafter. In June 2021, Mr. Tang Jitian was allegedly barred from leaving China to visit his gravely ill daughter in Japan on the grounds that his travel abroad may “endanger national security”. Although Mr. Tang Jitian’s family were reportedly able to reach him by telephone on two occasions prior to 5 January 2022, there has not been any further contact and he has not been given access to any means to contact his family or lawyer. It is further believed that he was under police control during those phone calls. At present, his fate and whereabouts are unknown. \n\n### The cases of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheg \n\nFurther to the information contained in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 (CHN 4/2021), it has been alleged that the health of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu has deteriorated significantly while in detention. It has been further alleged that the lawyers of these five human rights defenders have been obstructed in their defence of their clients including by not being permitted to make copies of case files and in some instances, to review case files at all. During its 91st session in September 2021, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding the detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi to be arbitrary (A/HRC/WGAD/2021/30). On 31 December 2021, Mr. Qin Yongpei was tried in what was a closed hearing, with his wife being the only person from Mr. Qin Yongpei’s side permitted to attend. \n\nThere has been no further information on the whereabouts or wellbeing of Mr. Gao Zhisheng since the above communication was sent to your Excellency’s Government. According to reports, he has been forcibly disappeared since 13 August 2017 and his family have not received any further information on his fate and whereabouts. \n\n**While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we express our serious concern regarding the detention and subsequent enforced disappearance of human rights defenders Messrs. Wang Jianbing and Yang Maodong, and their subsequent charging.** We also raise grave concerns at the continued enforced disappearance of Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, and the allegations of lack of due process in the judicial proceedings against and the treatment in detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu. \n\nThese arrests of human rights defenders for carrying out their legitimate work, or the exercise of human rights, under the pretext of national security is incompatible with international human rights law. Given that six of the nine human rights defenders named in this communication have been detained on suspicion of, or charged with, subversion of state power “inciting subversion of state power”, which falls under China’s national security legislation, we reiterate our alarm at the continued use of national security provisions of the Criminal Code to restrict the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. These rights are enshrined in articles 19 and 20(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in this regard we also wish to refer to the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also known as the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular articles 1, 2, 5, 6 and 12. \n\nWe remind your Excellency’s Government that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes the right to a critical or dissenting opinion of Government activities and policy. If the above allegations are confirmed, the misuse of national security legislation with penal sanctions against individuals peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression would be contrary to China’s obligations under international human rights law. We are also concerned that this is indicative of a broader pattern of growing restrictions on the space for discussion and debate in China, where those who defend and exercise this right find themselves increasingly at risk of medium to long-term incarceration, often under the framework of national security or counter-terrorism legislation. \n\nWe are seriously concerned by the lack of information about the physical integrity of the human rights defenders included in this communication, and their access to adequate medical care and treatment while deprived of their liberty. This is particularly true for Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown or unconfirmed, and for Mr. Yang Maodong who was detained incommunicado and subjected to enforced disappearance for over a month. We wish to recall that, failure to acknowledge a deprivation of liberty by State agents or the refusal to acknowledge detention are constitutive elements of an enforced disappearance, regardless of the duration of the deprivation of liberty or concealment concerned. Also, by depriving persons of their liberty, States assume responsibility to care for their life and bodily integrity. Due to this heightened duty of care, States must take any necessary measures to protect the lives of individuals deprived of their liberty. Inadequate conditions of detention can be a factor contributing to deaths and serious injury in detention, and when they are seriously inadequate they can constitute an immediate or long-term danger to life. \n\nIn view of the above, we would also like to refer to articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which prohibits in absolute terms arbitrary deprivation of liberty and guarantees everyone the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of their rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against them. In this context, we would also like refer to relevant provisions of the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of their liberty to bring proceedings before a court. \n\nThe United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances also recognises the right to be held in an officially recognised place of detention, and the obligation of the detaining authorities to make available accurate information on the detention of persons and their place of detention to their family, counsel or other persons with a legitimate interest (article 10). \n\nWe reiterate our concern at the alleged denial of due process of the abovementioned human rights defenders, including in connection to their access to legal counsel. In this regard, we would like to refer to articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights providing for trial in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal at which all the guarantees necessary for an adequate defence are respected. These include, among others, the right to legal counsel of one’s own choosing and to communicate with it as necessary, the right to be tried without delay, and the right to be protected from having to testify against oneself or to confess guilt. \n\nWe are deeply concerned that the travel bans issued against Mr. Yang Maodong and Mr. Tang Jitian are in retaliation for their human rights work and moreover, such bans are preventing, or have prevented, them from assisting close family members during the terminal phases of serious illnesses. We would like to refer to article 13(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in this regard. \n\nWe reiterate the concerns expressed in previous communications sent to Your Excellency’s Government on 13 August 2020 (AL CHN 16/2020),on 20 September 2020 (OL CHN 17/2020) and on 28 April 2021 (AL CHN 4/2021) at the broad scope of the crime defined as subversion in national legislation; its negative impact on freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association; its implications on the rule of law; and the interference with the ability of civil society organizations to perform their lawful function. We underscore that security and human rights are intertwined and not separate.1 Effective security demands the protection of rights in a holistic and integrated way. Here we stress the collective interdependency of the compendium of rights set out in the UDHR, which function to collectively complement and enhance the advancement of the security and rights of each individual in society. We acknowledge your Excellency’s Government’s reply of 23 and 30 October 2020. \n\nIn connection with the above alleged facts and concerns, please refer to the Annex on Reference to international human rights law attached to this letter which cites international human rights instruments and standards relevant to these allegations. \n\nWe are issuing this appeal in order to safeguard the rights of abovementioned individuals from irreparable harm and without prejudicing any eventual legal determination. \n\nAs it is our responsibility, under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention, we would be grateful for your observations on the following matters: \n\n1. Please provide any additional information and/or comment(s) you may have on the above-mentioned allegations. \n2. **Please explain the factual and legal basis of the charges facing Mr. Wang Jianbing and how the charges are compatible with international law. Furthermore, please provide information about whether Mr. Wang Jianbing has had access to his family and legal counsel, and if so, please provide the dates and times of that access. Please also provide information on the state of health of Mr. Wang Jianbing.** \n3. Please provide information about the fate and whereabouts of Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, and, if detained, the grounds on which they are being held, the authority responsible for supervising the deprivation of liberty, the place where they are held and elements relating to their state of health. Please also confirm whether they, along with Mr. Yang Maodong, have had access to the respective family and legal counsel, and if so, please specify when. Lastly, please provide information about the grounds for Messrs. Yang Maodong and Tang Jitian’s continued bans on leaving China. \n4. Please provide information regarding measures taken to ensure that those deprived of their liberty, or their representatives, may take proceedings before a court to challenge the lawfulness of the respective deprivation of liberty, and order their release. Please also provide information concerning measures taken to investigate the aforementioned alleged enforced disappearances, to identify those responsible, and prosecute and, where appropriate, sanction them. \n5. Please provide the information requested in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 and furthermore please describe the conditions of detention for Ding Jiaxi, Xu Zhiyong, Chang Weiping, Qin Yongpei, and Li Qiaochu. Please confirm if their appointed legal representatives have had unhindered access to information that would aid their clients’ defence. Please also provide the information requested in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 and furthermore please describe the conditions of detention for Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei, and Ms. Li Qiaochu. Please also confirm if their appointed legal representatives have had unhindered access to information that would aid their clients’ defence. \n6. Please provide information on how the definition of “subversion of State power” is compatible with the principle of legal certainty established under the UDHR. We would appreciate receiving a response within 60 days. Past this delay, this communication and any response received from your Excellency’s Government will be made public via the communications reporting website. They will also subsequently be made available in the usual report to be presented to the Human Rights Council. \n\nWe would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency’s Government that should sources submit the allegations concerning Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian for the consideration of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances under its humanitarian procedure, their cases will be considered by the Working Group according to its methods of work, in which case your Excellency’s Government will be informed by separate correspondence. \n\nWe would also like to inform your Excellency’s Government that after having transmitted this joint urgent appeal to the Government, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention may transmit the case through its regular procedure in order to render an opinion on whether the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary or not. This communication of allegations in no way prejudges any opinion the Working Group may render. The Government is required to respond separately to the urgent action procedure and the Working Group’s regular procedure. \n\nWhile awaiting a reply, we urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to prevent any irreparable damage to the life and integrity of the persons concerned, halt the alleged violations and prevent their re-occurrence and in the event that the investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, to ensure the accountability of any person(s) responsible for the alleged violations. \n\nPlease accept, Excellency, the assurances of our highest consideration. \n\nMary Lawlor   \nSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders\n\nMiriam Estrada-Castillo   \nVice-Chair of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention\n\nLuciano Hazan   \nChair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances\n\nIrene Khan   \nSpecial Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression\n\nClement Nyaletsossi Voule   \nSpecial Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association\n\nFionnuala Ní Aoláin   \nSpecial Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism\n\n来源：https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=27049","source":"_posts/un_report.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 联合国公布今年2月寄信给中国政府，对人权捍卫者王建兵被剥夺自由表示关注\ndate: 2022-04-11T02:23:13.987Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/OEA8P1m.png\ncategories:\n  - 媒体报道\ntags:\n  - English\n---\n联合国最近公布了今年2月发给中国政府的信件，对人权捍卫者 #王建兵 #郭飞雄 和 #唐吉田 被剥夺自由表示关注并要求政府提供更多信息。信件还追问了去年4月的信件中提到的多起维权人士被迫害的案件，包括高智晟、李翘楚、许志永、丁家喜、常玮平和覃永沛。\n\n以下为联合国信件全文，我们将其中提到王建兵的部分加粗表示。\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nExcellency, \n\nWe have the honour to address you in our capacities as Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 43/16, 42/22, 45/3, 43/4, 41/12 and 40/16. \n\nIn this connection, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency’s Government information we have received concerning the alleged arrest and subsequent enforced disappearances of human rights defenders **Mr. Wang Jianbing** and Mr. Yang Maodong (pen-name Guo Feixiong), who are facing the charge of “inciting subversion of State power”, and concerning Mr. Tang Jitian, who has been reported as forcibly disappeared since 10 December 2021. \n\n**Mr. Wang Jianbing is a human rights defender who works to promote labour rights and the rights of persons with disabilities. For the last few years, Mr. Wang has worked for an NGO championing equitable treatment for people with disabilities and in 2018 turned his attention to supporting the cause of workers with occupational diseases. He has also been an outspoken advocate of the #metoo campaign in China.**\n\nMr. Yang Maodong, commonly known by his pen-name Guo Feixiong, is a veteran human rights defender who has been the subject of eight urgent appeals and allegation letters sent to your Excellency's Government; on 6 March 2006; on 19 October 2006; on 1 December 2006; on 30 November 2007 and on 22 October 2013 respectively (CHN 12/2013), 7 August 2015 (CHN 8/2015), 23 December 2015 (CHN 13/2015), 3 June 2016 (CHN 4/2016) and 20 July 2016 (CHN 6/2016). \n\nHe has served a total of 11 years in prison since 2007. In 2019, he was released following the completion of a six-year sentence for “gathering crowds to disturb social order” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. \n\nMr. Tang Jitian is a human rights lawyer who was disbarred in 2010, allegedly as a result of his taking on of human rights cases. He was the subject of four previous communications sent to your Excellency’s Government, dated 7 November 2008, see A/HRC/10/12/Add.1, para. 586- 591, 10 June 2009, see A/HRC/13/22/Add.1, para. 345-352, 27 April 2010, see A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, para. 388-392, and 428-465 and 16 July 2014 (CHN 7/2014).\n\nWe would further like to follow up on cases raised in a communication sent to your Excellency’s government dated 28 April 2021 (CHN 4/2021), namely those of Mr. Qin Yongpei, Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheng. We thank your Excellency's Government for its response, dated 26 June 2021, and note that it stated, “Information on the cases mentioned in the letter will be provided subsequently”. We regret that this information has not yet been received and use this opportunity to seek further clarification. Furthermore, during its 91st session in September 2021, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding the detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi to be arbitrary (A/HRC/WGAD/2021/30). \n\nAccording to the information received: \n\n### The case of Mr. Wang Jianbing \n\n**Mr. Wang Jianbing was detained by police officers from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at his home on 19 September 2021, in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance (i.e. deprived of his liberty and this was followed by a denial of such deprivation and the concealment of his fate and whereabouts). His residence was also searched and a number of personal items were confiscated. It is believed that Mr. Wang Jianbing was detained as a result of his holding a number of private gatherings at his residence in the preceding months. In the aftermath of his arrest, a number of his acquaintances were questioned as to who had attended the meetings, and were allegedly pressured to testify that the meetings were of a political nature, and to sign a document stating that Mr. Wang Jianbing had participated in meetings which “subvert State power”.** \n\nA formal arrest notice dated 27 October 2021 (i.e. more than one month after the actual deprivation of liberty took place) was received by Mr. Wang Jianbing’s family stating that the human rights defender had been arrested on suspicion of “inciting subversion of State power” and is being held in Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre, although his case has not yet been sent to the prosecutor. Prior to their receipt of this notice, Mr. Wang Jianbing’s family had not received any legal documentation as to his status, his whereabouts or the charges he was facing. Neither Mr. Wang Jianbing’s lawyer nor his family have been permitted access to visit him since his detention on 19 September 2021 to confirm his whereabouts. \n\n### The case of Mr. Yang Maodong (Guo Feixiong) \n\nMr. Yang Maodong was forcibly disappeared on 5 December 2021 and family or friends did not receive any information as to his fate and whereabouts until 12 January 2022, when the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a notification to his family that he had been formally arrested. He has reportedly been charged with “inciting subversion of State power” under article 105(2) of China’s Criminal Law, and is being held in Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre. Neither Mr. Yang Maodong’s lawyer nor his family have been permitted access to visit him since his detention to confirm his whereabouts. Prior to his enforced disappearance, Mr. Yang Maodong had been prevented from leaving China to travel to the USA to be with his wife, Ms. Zhang Qing, who was suffering from late stage bowel cancer. On 29 November 2021, Mr. Yang Maodong wrote an open letter to Premier Li Keqiang asking him to investigate why the Ministry for Public Security was continuing to block his application to go abroad. Ms. Zhang Qing died on 10 January 2022. \n\n### The case of Mr. Tang Jitian \n\nThe fate and whereabouts of Mr. Tang Jitian have been unknown since 10 December 2021 and there are legitimate fears that he is detained by authorities. He was due to attend an event hosted by the European Union Delegation in Beijing on 10 December to mark Human Rights Day, but he did not appear at the event and friends and family were not able to contact him for several weeks thereafter. In June 2021, Mr. Tang Jitian was allegedly barred from leaving China to visit his gravely ill daughter in Japan on the grounds that his travel abroad may “endanger national security”. Although Mr. Tang Jitian’s family were reportedly able to reach him by telephone on two occasions prior to 5 January 2022, there has not been any further contact and he has not been given access to any means to contact his family or lawyer. It is further believed that he was under police control during those phone calls. At present, his fate and whereabouts are unknown. \n\n### The cases of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheg \n\nFurther to the information contained in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 (CHN 4/2021), it has been alleged that the health of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu has deteriorated significantly while in detention. It has been further alleged that the lawyers of these five human rights defenders have been obstructed in their defence of their clients including by not being permitted to make copies of case files and in some instances, to review case files at all. During its 91st session in September 2021, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding the detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi to be arbitrary (A/HRC/WGAD/2021/30). On 31 December 2021, Mr. Qin Yongpei was tried in what was a closed hearing, with his wife being the only person from Mr. Qin Yongpei’s side permitted to attend. \n\nThere has been no further information on the whereabouts or wellbeing of Mr. Gao Zhisheng since the above communication was sent to your Excellency’s Government. According to reports, he has been forcibly disappeared since 13 August 2017 and his family have not received any further information on his fate and whereabouts. \n\n**While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we express our serious concern regarding the detention and subsequent enforced disappearance of human rights defenders Messrs. Wang Jianbing and Yang Maodong, and their subsequent charging.** We also raise grave concerns at the continued enforced disappearance of Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, and the allegations of lack of due process in the judicial proceedings against and the treatment in detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu. \n\nThese arrests of human rights defenders for carrying out their legitimate work, or the exercise of human rights, under the pretext of national security is incompatible with international human rights law. Given that six of the nine human rights defenders named in this communication have been detained on suspicion of, or charged with, subversion of state power “inciting subversion of state power”, which falls under China’s national security legislation, we reiterate our alarm at the continued use of national security provisions of the Criminal Code to restrict the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. These rights are enshrined in articles 19 and 20(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in this regard we also wish to refer to the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also known as the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular articles 1, 2, 5, 6 and 12. \n\nWe remind your Excellency’s Government that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes the right to a critical or dissenting opinion of Government activities and policy. If the above allegations are confirmed, the misuse of national security legislation with penal sanctions against individuals peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression would be contrary to China’s obligations under international human rights law. We are also concerned that this is indicative of a broader pattern of growing restrictions on the space for discussion and debate in China, where those who defend and exercise this right find themselves increasingly at risk of medium to long-term incarceration, often under the framework of national security or counter-terrorism legislation. \n\nWe are seriously concerned by the lack of information about the physical integrity of the human rights defenders included in this communication, and their access to adequate medical care and treatment while deprived of their liberty. This is particularly true for Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown or unconfirmed, and for Mr. Yang Maodong who was detained incommunicado and subjected to enforced disappearance for over a month. We wish to recall that, failure to acknowledge a deprivation of liberty by State agents or the refusal to acknowledge detention are constitutive elements of an enforced disappearance, regardless of the duration of the deprivation of liberty or concealment concerned. Also, by depriving persons of their liberty, States assume responsibility to care for their life and bodily integrity. Due to this heightened duty of care, States must take any necessary measures to protect the lives of individuals deprived of their liberty. Inadequate conditions of detention can be a factor contributing to deaths and serious injury in detention, and when they are seriously inadequate they can constitute an immediate or long-term danger to life. \n\nIn view of the above, we would also like to refer to articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which prohibits in absolute terms arbitrary deprivation of liberty and guarantees everyone the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of their rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against them. In this context, we would also like refer to relevant provisions of the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of their liberty to bring proceedings before a court. \n\nThe United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances also recognises the right to be held in an officially recognised place of detention, and the obligation of the detaining authorities to make available accurate information on the detention of persons and their place of detention to their family, counsel or other persons with a legitimate interest (article 10). \n\nWe reiterate our concern at the alleged denial of due process of the abovementioned human rights defenders, including in connection to their access to legal counsel. In this regard, we would like to refer to articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights providing for trial in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal at which all the guarantees necessary for an adequate defence are respected. These include, among others, the right to legal counsel of one’s own choosing and to communicate with it as necessary, the right to be tried without delay, and the right to be protected from having to testify against oneself or to confess guilt. \n\nWe are deeply concerned that the travel bans issued against Mr. Yang Maodong and Mr. Tang Jitian are in retaliation for their human rights work and moreover, such bans are preventing, or have prevented, them from assisting close family members during the terminal phases of serious illnesses. We would like to refer to article 13(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in this regard. \n\nWe reiterate the concerns expressed in previous communications sent to Your Excellency’s Government on 13 August 2020 (AL CHN 16/2020),on 20 September 2020 (OL CHN 17/2020) and on 28 April 2021 (AL CHN 4/2021) at the broad scope of the crime defined as subversion in national legislation; its negative impact on freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association; its implications on the rule of law; and the interference with the ability of civil society organizations to perform their lawful function. We underscore that security and human rights are intertwined and not separate.1 Effective security demands the protection of rights in a holistic and integrated way. Here we stress the collective interdependency of the compendium of rights set out in the UDHR, which function to collectively complement and enhance the advancement of the security and rights of each individual in society. We acknowledge your Excellency’s Government’s reply of 23 and 30 October 2020. \n\nIn connection with the above alleged facts and concerns, please refer to the Annex on Reference to international human rights law attached to this letter which cites international human rights instruments and standards relevant to these allegations. \n\nWe are issuing this appeal in order to safeguard the rights of abovementioned individuals from irreparable harm and without prejudicing any eventual legal determination. \n\nAs it is our responsibility, under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention, we would be grateful for your observations on the following matters: \n\n1. Please provide any additional information and/or comment(s) you may have on the above-mentioned allegations. \n2. **Please explain the factual and legal basis of the charges facing Mr. Wang Jianbing and how the charges are compatible with international law. Furthermore, please provide information about whether Mr. Wang Jianbing has had access to his family and legal counsel, and if so, please provide the dates and times of that access. Please also provide information on the state of health of Mr. Wang Jianbing.** \n3. Please provide information about the fate and whereabouts of Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, and, if detained, the grounds on which they are being held, the authority responsible for supervising the deprivation of liberty, the place where they are held and elements relating to their state of health. Please also confirm whether they, along with Mr. Yang Maodong, have had access to the respective family and legal counsel, and if so, please specify when. Lastly, please provide information about the grounds for Messrs. Yang Maodong and Tang Jitian’s continued bans on leaving China. \n4. Please provide information regarding measures taken to ensure that those deprived of their liberty, or their representatives, may take proceedings before a court to challenge the lawfulness of the respective deprivation of liberty, and order their release. Please also provide information concerning measures taken to investigate the aforementioned alleged enforced disappearances, to identify those responsible, and prosecute and, where appropriate, sanction them. \n5. Please provide the information requested in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 and furthermore please describe the conditions of detention for Ding Jiaxi, Xu Zhiyong, Chang Weiping, Qin Yongpei, and Li Qiaochu. Please confirm if their appointed legal representatives have had unhindered access to information that would aid their clients’ defence.

They will also subsequently be made available in the usual report to be presented to the Human Rights Council. \n\nWe would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency’s Government that should sources submit the allegations concerning Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian for the consideration of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances under its humanitarian procedure, their cases will be considered by the Working Group according to its methods of work, in which case your Excellency’s Government will be informed by separate correspondence. \n\nWe would also like to inform your Excellency’s Government that after having transmitted this joint urgent appeal to the Government, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention may transmit the case through its regular procedure in order to render an opinion on whether the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary or not.

For the last few years, Mr. Wang has worked for an NGO championing equitable treatment for people with disabilities and in 2018 turned his attention to supporting the cause of workers with occupational diseases. He has also been an outspoken advocate of the #metoo campaign in China.</strong></p>\n<p>Mr. Yang Maodong, commonly known by his pen-name Guo Feixiong, is a veteran human rights defender who has been the subject of eight urgent appeals and allegation letters sent to your Excellency’s Government; on 6 March 2006; on 19 October 2006; on 1 December 2006; on 30 November 2007 and on 22 October 2013 respectively (CHN 12/2013), 7 August 2015 (CHN 8/2015), 23 December 2015 (CHN 13/2015), 3 June 2016 (CHN 4/2016) and 20 July 2016 (CHN 6/2016). </p>\n<p>He has served a total of 11 years in prison since 2007. In 2019, he was released following the completion of a six-year sentence for “gathering crowds to disturb social order” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”. </p>\n<p>Mr. Tang Jitian is a human rights lawyer who was disbarred in 2010, allegedly as a result of his taking on of human rights cases. He was the subject of four previous communications sent to your Excellency’s Government, dated 7 November 2008, see A/HRC/10/12/Add.1, para. 586- 591, 10 June 2009, see A/HRC/13/22/Add.1, para. 345-352, 27 April 2010, see A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, para. 388-392, and 428-465 and 16 July 2014 (CHN 7/2014).</p>\n<p>We would further like to follow up on cases raised in a communication sent to your Excellency’s government dated 28 April 2021 (CHN 4/2021), namely those of Mr. Qin Yongpei, Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheng. We thank your Excellency’s Government for its response, dated 26 June 2021, and note that it stated, “Information on the cases mentioned in the letter will be provided subsequently”. We regret that this information has not yet been received and use this opportunity to seek further clarification. Furthermore, during its 91st session in September 2021, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding the detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi to be arbitrary (A/HRC/WGAD/2021/30). </p>\n<p>According to the information received: </p>\n<h3 id=\"The-case-of-Mr-Wang-Jianbing\"><a href=\"#The-case-of-Mr-Wang-Jianbing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The case of Mr. Wang Jianbing\"></a>The case of Mr. Wang Jianbing</h3><p><strong>Mr. Wang Jianbing was detained by police officers from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at his home on 19 September 2021, in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance (i.e. deprived of his liberty and this was followed by a denial of such deprivation and the concealment of his fate and whereabouts). His residence was also searched and a number of personal items were confiscated. It is believed that Mr. Wang Jianbing was detained as a result of his holding a number of private gatherings at his residence in the preceding months. In the aftermath of his arrest, a number of his acquaintances were questioned as to who had attended the meetings, and were allegedly pressured to testify that the meetings were of a political nature, and to sign a document stating that Mr. Wang Jianbing had participated in meetings which “subvert State power”.</strong> </p>\n<p>A formal arrest notice dated 27 October 2021 (i.e. more than one month after the actual deprivation of liberty took place) was received by Mr. Wang Jianbing’s family stating that the human rights defender had been arrested on suspicion of “inciting subversion of State power” and is being held in Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre, although his case has not yet been sent to the prosecutor. Prior to their receipt of this notice, Mr. Wang Jianbing’s family had not received any legal documentation as to his status, his whereabouts or the charges he was facing. Neither Mr. Wang Jianbing’s lawyer nor his family have been permitted access to visit him since his detention on 19 September 2021 to confirm his whereabouts. </p>\n<h3 id=\"The-case-of-Mr-Yang-Maodong-Guo-Feixiong\"><a href=\"#The-case-of-Mr-Yang-Maodong-Guo-Feixiong\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The case of Mr. Yang Maodong (Guo Feixiong)\"></a>The case of Mr. Yang Maodong (Guo Feixiong)</h3><p>Mr. Yang Maodong was forcibly disappeared on 5 December 2021 and family or friends did not receive any information as to his fate and whereabouts until 12 January 2022, when the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a notification to his family that he had been formally arrested. He has reportedly been charged with “inciting subversion of State power” under article 105(2) of China’s Criminal Law, and is being held in Guangzhou No.1 Detention Centre. Neither Mr. Yang Maodong’s lawyer nor his family have been permitted access to visit him since his detention to confirm his whereabouts. Prior to his enforced disappearance, Mr. Yang Maodong had been prevented from leaving China to travel to the USA to be with his wife, Ms. Zhang Qing, who was suffering from late stage bowel cancer. On 29 November 2021, Mr. Yang Maodong wrote an open letter to Premier Li Keqiang asking him to investigate why the Ministry for Public Security was continuing to block his application to go abroad. Ms. Zhang Qing died on 10 January 2022. </p>\n<h3 id=\"The-case-of-Mr-Tang-Jitian\"><a href=\"#The-case-of-Mr-Tang-Jitian\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The case of Mr. Tang Jitian\"></a>The case of Mr. Tang Jitian</h3><p>The fate and whereabouts of Mr. Tang Jitian have been unknown since 10 December 2021 and there are legitimate fears that he is detained by authorities. He was due to attend an event hosted by the European Union Delegation in Beijing on 10 December to mark Human Rights Day, but he did not appear at the event and friends and family were not able to contact him for several weeks thereafter. In June 2021, Mr. Tang Jitian was allegedly barred from leaving China to visit his gravely ill daughter in Japan on the grounds that his travel abroad may “endanger national security”. Although Mr. Tang Jitian’s family were reportedly able to reach him by telephone on two occasions prior to 5 January 2022, there has not been any further contact and he has not been given access to any means to contact his family or lawyer. It is further believed that he was under police control during those phone calls. At present, his fate and whereabouts are unknown. </p>\n<h3 id=\"The-cases-of-Mr-Ding-Jiaxi-Mr-Xu-Zhiyong-Mr-Chang-Weiping-Mr-Qin-Yongpei-Ms-Li-Qiaochu-and-Mr-Gao-Zhisheg\"><a href=\"#The-cases-of-Mr-Ding-Jiaxi-Mr-Xu-Zhiyong-Mr-Chang-Weiping-Mr-Qin-Yongpei-Ms-Li-Qiaochu-and-Mr-Gao-Zhisheg\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The cases of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheg\"></a>The cases of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheg</h3><p>Further to the information contained in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 (CHN 4/2021), it has been alleged that the health of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu has deteriorated significantly while in detention. It has been further alleged that the lawyers of these five human rights defenders have been obstructed in their defence of their clients including by not being permitted to make copies of case files and in some instances, to review case files at all. During its 91st session in September 2021, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding the detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi to be arbitrary (A/HRC/WGAD/2021/30). On 31 December 2021, Mr. Qin Yongpei was tried in what was a closed hearing, with his wife being the only person from Mr. Qin Yongpei’s side permitted to attend. </p>\n<p>There has been no further information on the whereabouts or wellbeing of Mr. Gao Zhisheng since the above communication was sent to your Excellency’s Government. According to reports, he has been forcibly disappeared since 13 August 2017 and his family have not received any further information on his fate and whereabouts. </p>\n<p><strong>While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we express our serious concern regarding the detention and subsequent enforced disappearance of human rights defenders Messrs. Wang Jianbing and Yang Maodong, and their subsequent charging.</strong> We also raise grave concerns at the continued enforced disappearance of Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, and the allegations of lack of due process in the judicial proceedings against and the treatment in detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu. </p>\n<p>These arrests of human rights defenders for carrying out their legitimate work, or the exercise of human rights, under the pretext of national security is incompatible with international human rights law. Given that six of the nine human rights defenders named in this communication have been detained on suspicion of, or charged with, subversion of state power “inciting subversion of state power”, which falls under China’s national security legislation, we reiterate our alarm at the continued use of national security provisions of the Criminal Code to restrict the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. These rights are enshrined in articles 19 and 20(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in this regard we also wish to refer to the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also known as the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular articles 1, 2, 5, 6 and 12. </p>\n<p>We remind your Excellency’s Government that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes the right to a critical or dissenting opinion of Government activities and policy. If the above allegations are confirmed, the misuse of national security legislation with penal sanctions against individuals peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression would be contrary to China’s obligations under international human rights law. We are also concerned that this is indicative of a broader pattern of growing restrictions on the space for discussion and debate in China, where those who defend and exercise this right find themselves increasingly at risk of medium to long-term incarceration, often under the framework of national security or counter-terrorism legislation. </p>\n<p>We are seriously concerned by the lack of information about the physical integrity of the human rights defenders included in this communication, and their access to adequate medical care and treatment while deprived of their liberty. This is particularly true for Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown or unconfirmed, and for Mr. Yang Maodong who was detained incommunicado and subjected to enforced disappearance for over a month. We wish to recall that, failure to acknowledge a deprivation of liberty by State agents or the refusal to acknowledge detention are constitutive elements of an enforced disappearance, regardless of the duration of the deprivation of liberty or concealment concerned. Also, by depriving persons of their liberty, States assume responsibility to care for their life and bodily integrity. Due to this heightened duty of care, States must take any necessary measures to protect the lives of individuals deprived of their liberty. Inadequate conditions of detention can be a factor contributing to deaths and serious injury in detention, and when they are seriously inadequate they can constitute an immediate or long-term danger to life. </p>\n<p>In view of the above, we would also like to refer to articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which prohibits in absolute terms arbitrary deprivation of liberty and guarantees everyone the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of their rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against them. In this context, we would also like refer to relevant provisions of the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of their liberty to bring proceedings before a court. </p>\n<p>The United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances also recognises the right to be held in an officially recognised place of detention, and the obligation of the detaining authorities to make available accurate information on the detention of persons and their place of detention to their family, counsel or other persons with a legitimate interest (article 10). </p>\n<p>We reiterate our concern at the alleged denial of due process of the abovementioned human rights defenders, including in connection to their access to legal counsel. In this regard, we would like to refer to articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights providing for trial in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal at which all the guarantees necessary for an adequate defence are respected. These include, among others, the right to legal counsel of one’s own choosing and to communicate with it as necessary, the right to be tried without delay, and the right to be protected from having to testify against oneself or to confess guilt. </p>\n<p>We are deeply concerned that the travel bans issued against Mr. Yang Maodong and Mr. Tang Jitian are in retaliation for their human rights work and moreover, such bans are preventing, or have prevented, them from assisting close family members during the terminal phases of serious illnesses. We would like to refer to article 13(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in this regard. </p>\n<p>We reiterate the concerns expressed in previous communications sent to Your Excellency’s Government on 13 August 2020 (AL CHN 16/2020),on 20 September 2020 (OL CHN 17/2020) and on 28 April 2021 (AL CHN 4/2021) at the broad scope of the crime defined as subversion in national legislation; its negative impact on freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association; its implications on the rule of law; and the interference with the ability of civil society organizations to perform their lawful function. We underscore that security and human rights are intertwined and not separate.1 Effective security demands the protection of rights in a holistic and integrated way. Here we stress the collective interdependency of the compendium of rights set out in the UDHR, which function to collectively complement and enhance the advancement of the security and rights of each individual in society. We acknowledge your Excellency’s Government’s reply of 23 and 30 October 2020. </p>\n<p>In connection with the above alleged facts and concerns, please refer to the Annex on Reference to international human rights law attached to this letter which cites international human rights instruments and standards relevant to these allegations. </p>\n<p>We are issuing this appeal in order to safeguard the rights of abovementioned individuals from irreparable harm and without prejudicing any eventual legal determination. </p>\n<p>As it is our responsibility, under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention, we would be grateful for your observations on the following matters: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please provide any additional information and/or comment(s) you may have on the above-mentioned allegations. </li>\n<li><strong>Please explain the factual and legal basis of the charges facing Mr. Wang Jianbing and how the charges are compatible with international law. Furthermore, please provide information about whether Mr. Wang Jianbing has had access to his family and legal counsel, and if so, please provide the dates and times of that access.

Lastly, please provide information about the grounds for Messrs. Yang Maodong and Tang Jitian’s continued bans on leaving China. </li>\n<li>Please provide information regarding measures taken to ensure that those deprived of their liberty, or their representatives, may take proceedings before a court to challenge the lawfulness of the respective deprivation of liberty, and order their release. Please also provide information concerning measures taken to investigate the aforementioned alleged enforced disappearances, to identify those responsible, and prosecute and, where appropriate, sanction them. </li>\n<li>Please provide the information requested in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 and furthermore please describe the conditions of detention for Ding Jiaxi, Xu Zhiyong, Chang Weiping, Qin Yongpei, and Li Qiaochu. Please confirm if their appointed legal representatives have had unhindered access to information that would aid their clients’ defence.

We would appreciate receiving a response within 60 days. Past this delay, this communication and any response received from your Excellency’s Government will be made public via the communications reporting website. They will also subsequently be made available in the usual report to be presented to the Human Rights Council. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>We would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency’s Government that should sources submit the allegations concerning Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian for the consideration of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances under its humanitarian procedure, their cases will be considered by the Working Group according to its methods of work, in which case your Excellency’s Government will be informed by separate correspondence. </p>\n<p>We would also like to inform your Excellency’s Government that after having transmitted this joint urgent appeal to the Government, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention may transmit the case through its regular procedure in order to render an opinion on whether the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary or not.

On 29 November 2021, Mr. Yang Maodong wrote an open letter to Premier Li Keqiang asking him to investigate why the Ministry for Public Security was continuing to block his application to go abroad. Ms. Zhang Qing died on 10 January 2022. </p>\n<h3 id=\"The-case-of-Mr-Tang-Jitian\"><a href=\"#The-case-of-Mr-Tang-Jitian\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The case of Mr. Tang Jitian\"></a>The case of Mr. Tang Jitian</h3><p>The fate and whereabouts of Mr. Tang Jitian have been unknown since 10 December 2021 and there are legitimate fears that he is detained by authorities. He was due to attend an event hosted by the European Union Delegation in Beijing on 10 December to mark Human Rights Day, but he did not appear at the event and friends and family were not able to contact him for several weeks thereafter. In June 2021, Mr. Tang Jitian was allegedly barred from leaving China to visit his gravely ill daughter in Japan on the grounds that his travel abroad may “endanger national security”. Although Mr. Tang Jitian’s family were reportedly able to reach him by telephone on two occasions prior to 5 January 2022, there has not been any further contact and he has not been given access to any means to contact his family or lawyer. It is further believed that he was under police control during those phone calls. At present, his fate and whereabouts are unknown. </p>\n<h3 id=\"The-cases-of-Mr-Ding-Jiaxi-Mr-Xu-Zhiyong-Mr-Chang-Weiping-Mr-Qin-Yongpei-Ms-Li-Qiaochu-and-Mr-Gao-Zhisheg\"><a href=\"#The-cases-of-Mr-Ding-Jiaxi-Mr-Xu-Zhiyong-Mr-Chang-Weiping-Mr-Qin-Yongpei-Ms-Li-Qiaochu-and-Mr-Gao-Zhisheg\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The cases of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheg\"></a>The cases of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei, Ms. Li Qiaochu and Mr. Gao Zhisheg</h3><p>Further to the information contained in the communication sent to your Excellency’s Government dated 28 April 2021 (CHN 4/2021), it has been alleged that the health of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu has deteriorated significantly while in detention. It has been further alleged that the lawyers of these five human rights defenders have been obstructed in their defence of their clients including by not being permitted to make copies of case files and in some instances, to review case files at all. During its 91st session in September 2021, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding the detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi to be arbitrary (A/HRC/WGAD/2021/30). On 31 December 2021, Mr. Qin Yongpei was tried in what was a closed hearing, with his wife being the only person from Mr. Qin Yongpei’s side permitted to attend. </p>\n<p>There has been no further information on the whereabouts or wellbeing of Mr. Gao Zhisheng since the above communication was sent to your Excellency’s Government. According to reports, he has been forcibly disappeared since 13 August 2017 and his family have not received any further information on his fate and whereabouts. </p>\n<p><strong>While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we express our serious concern regarding the detention and subsequent enforced disappearance of human rights defenders Messrs. Wang Jianbing and Yang Maodong, and their subsequent charging.</strong> We also raise grave concerns at the continued enforced disappearance of Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, and the allegations of lack of due process in the judicial proceedings against and the treatment in detention of Mr. Ding Jiaxi, Mr. Xu Zhiyong, Mr. Chang Weiping, Mr. Qin Yongpei and Ms. Li Qiaochu. </p>\n<p>These arrests of human rights defenders for carrying out their legitimate work, or the exercise of human rights, under the pretext of national security is incompatible with international human rights law. Given that six of the nine human rights defenders named in this communication have been detained on suspicion of, or charged with, subversion of state power “inciting subversion of state power”, which falls under China’s national security legislation, we reiterate our alarm at the continued use of national security provisions of the Criminal Code to restrict the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. These rights are enshrined in articles 19 and 20(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in this regard we also wish to refer to the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also known as the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in particular articles 1, 2, 5, 6 and 12. </p>\n<p>We remind your Excellency’s Government that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression includes the right to a critical or dissenting opinion of Government activities and policy. If the above allegations are confirmed, the misuse of national security legislation with penal sanctions against individuals peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression would be contrary to China’s obligations under international human rights law. We are also concerned that this is indicative of a broader pattern of growing restrictions on the space for discussion and debate in China, where those who defend and exercise this right find themselves increasingly at risk of medium to long-term incarceration, often under the framework of national security or counter-terrorism legislation. </p>\n<p>We are seriously concerned by the lack of information about the physical integrity of the human rights defenders included in this communication, and their access to adequate medical care and treatment while deprived of their liberty. This is particularly true for Messrs. Gao Zhisheng and Tang Jitian, whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown or unconfirmed, and for Mr. Yang Maodong who was detained incommunicado and subjected to enforced disappearance for over a month. We wish to recall that, failure to acknowledge a deprivation of liberty by State agents or the refusal to acknowledge detention are constitutive elements of an enforced disappearance, regardless of the duration of the deprivation of liberty or concealment concerned. Also, by depriving persons of their liberty, States assume responsibility to care for their life and bodily integrity. Due to this heightened duty of care, States must take any necessary measures to protect the lives of individuals deprived of their liberty. Inadequate conditions of detention can be a factor contributing to deaths and serious injury in detention, and when they are seriously inadequate they can constitute an immediate or long-term danger to life. </p>\n<p>In view of the above, we would also like to refer to articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which prohibits in absolute terms arbitrary deprivation of liberty and guarantees everyone the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of their rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against them. In this context, we would also like refer to relevant provisions of the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of their liberty to bring proceedings before a court. </p>\n<p>The United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances also recognises the right to be held in an officially recognised place of detention, and the obligation of the detaining authorities to make available accurate information on the detention of persons and their place of detention to their family, counsel or other persons with a legitimate interest (article 10). </p>\n<p>We reiterate our concern at the alleged denial of due process of the abovementioned human rights defenders, including in connection to their access to legal counsel. In this regard, we would like to refer to articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights providing for trial in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal at which all the guarantees necessary for an adequate defence are respected. These include, among others, the right to legal counsel of one’s own choosing and to communicate with it as necessary, the right to be tried without delay, and the right to be protected from having to testify against oneself or to confess guilt. </p>\n<p>We are deeply concerned that the travel bans issued against Mr. Yang Maodong and Mr. Tang Jitian are in retaliation for their human rights work and moreover, such bans are preventing, or have prevented, them from assisting close family members during the terminal phases of serious illnesses. We would like to refer to article 13(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in this regard. </p>\n<p>We reiterate the concerns expressed in previous communications sent to Your Excellency’s Government on 13 August 2020 (AL CHN 16/2020),on 20 September 2020 (OL CHN 17/2020) and on 28 April 2021 (AL CHN 4/2021) at the broad scope of the crime defined as subversion in national legislation; its negative impact on freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association; its implications on the rule of law; and the interference with the ability of civil society organizations to perform their lawful function. We underscore that security and human rights are intertwined and not separate.1 Effective security demands the protection of rights in a holistic and integrated way. Here we stress the collective interdependency of the compendium of rights set out in the UDHR, which function to collectively complement and enhance the advancement of the security and rights of each individual in society. We acknowledge your Excellency’s Government’s reply of 23 and 30 October 2020. </p>\n<p>In connection with the above alleged facts and concerns, please refer to the Annex on Reference to international human rights law attached to this letter which cites international human rights instruments and standards relevant to these allegations. </p>\n<p>We are issuing this appeal in order to safeguard the rights of abovementioned individuals from irreparable harm and without prejudicing any eventual legal determination. </p>\n<p>As it is our responsibility, under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention, we would be grateful for your observations on the following matters: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please provide any additional information and/or comment(s) you may have on the above-mentioned allegations. </li>\n<li><strong>Please explain the factual and legal basis of the charges facing Mr. Wang Jianbing and how the charges are compatible with international law.

On September 19, 2021, the Guangzhou Police forcibly arrested Huang and Wang who were at a weekly gathering at Wang's residence and placed them under residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL) on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\". It was not until early November 2021 that Huang and Wang’s family members received a \"notice of arrest\" issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. The notice showed that the pair were arrested with formal approval on October 27, and claimed that both of them were detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5a8oAbj.jpg)\n\n## 1. Review of Huang & Wang’s half-year detention\nThe situation of the pair's arrest and detainment remains in a black box. Since their disappearance on September 19, 2021, Huang and Wang's family and friends had only indirectly learnt about the arrest through other friends who were summoned by police. Though required by law, a \"notice of detention\" was never sent to their family members after the arrest and it was not until the end of January 2021, four months after their disappearance, when their family members received the notice confirming that Huang and Wang were accused of ‘inciting subversion of state power’ and were placed in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center.\n\nHowever, we later learned that Huang Xueqin is in fact in Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center, and whether Wang Jianbing is detained in the No. 1 Detention Center remains unknown. Their families and friends have tried several times over the past six months to send money to them. All attempts have failed, suggesting that the place of their detention on paper may not match the actual location or that they were detained under pseudonyms. We have no way of knowing the actual detention location or health situations of the pair.\n\nSince Huang and Wang's arrest, the Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, have continued local or cross-regional subpoenas or interrogations. Around 70 of Huang and Wang’s friends have been summoned by the police for interrogation. Without following legal procedure, the Guangzhou police interrogated their friends for up to 24 hours, some even several times, and forcibly searched and copied their electronic devices. The police also forced and threatened some of Huang & Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police. This means they have intimidated Huang & Wang to the point of admitting that they had participated in training activities that had the intention of “subverting state power” and fabricated the gathering at Jianbing’s apartment as a political event criticizing the government. In the past six months, the police have been using this way to manufacture illegal evidence to accuse Huang & Wang.\n\nBoth Huang & Wang’s attorney visit requests were declined. Two of their families' trusted attorneys currently represent Huang & Wang. Since October 2021, even though Wang’s attorney Xiao Yunyang has continuously submitted applications to the Guangzhou police requesting meetings with Wang and bail, all requests have been declined on the grounds of “involving national security”. The legitimacy of Xiao's attorney qualification was also questioned. Huang Xueqin's attorney's meeting requests in March 2022 were also declined.\n\n## 2. The Arrest of Huang & Wang Indicates a Profound Crackdown on Civil Society Networks in China\n\nSince 2015, the Chinese government has been speeding up its effort to shrink and close its local civic space. Civil society organizations and activists concerned with women's rights and labor rights have been subjected to crackdowns and criminal charges one after another. Following the mass political arrests such as the \"Feminist Five'', \"709\" Crackdown, and the \"123\" Labor Crackdown in 2015, as well as the Jasic Crackdown in 2018, the civil society networks in China have gradually become more and more fragmented, which has contributed to the looming fear over the activists. As a result of such dispiriting events, Huang & Wang organized the weekly social gatherings in their own apartment as an attempt to encourage depondent activists who cared about social issues. However, these perfectly normal weekly gatherings were deemed a major threat on \"national security\" by the Chinese government, and Huang & Wang were charged with the felony of \"Inciting Subversion of State Power\".\n\nThe Guangzhou police have repeatedly used “national security” as a reason to suppress civil society activities in the Huang & Wang case.\n\n1) The authorities viewed the gatherings at Wang's place as an \"activity\" that threatened national security. However, the crackdown taken by the local authorities were themselves a violation of citizens' freedom of speech and assembly, not to mention the gatherings were not created for discussing political issues, but were an informal network for young activists to support and keep each other company.\n\n2) The arrest of Huang and Wang also indicates a further crackdown on the remaining civil society networks in China. This is especially true among feminist and labor activists, e.g. labor activists’ support for workers have been seen as a major threat to social stability by the authorities for years, and more recently gender issues have also been heavily politicized by the authorities in the wake of the #MeToo movement and the Peng Shuai case.\n\n3) After Huang and Wang's arrest, the police refused to disclose any information about the two on the grounds of \"national security\". Furthermore, police revealed in private that Huang and Wang were detained incommunicado and isolated, which suggests that the police might have abused RSDL (a UN expert-identified form of incommunicado detention). “National security” was also used by the police as an excuse to deny any meetings between Huang, Wang and their respective lawyers, which denies the pair their basic legal rights and denies the public its right to know.\n\nHuang and Wang's experience encapsulates the Chinese government's deepening crackdown on its domestic civil society networks. After the total and complete suppression and shutdown of the domestic civil organizations, the Chinese government has been attempting to further destroy the remaining networks, including those who are comparatively more low-profile and less well-known, which continues to create a looming fear among activists. This change in direction would be more fatal for the social justice and political freedom in China. Dr. Li Wenliang, the covid-19 whistleblower who died from the virus in Wuhan, once said, \"A healthy society should not have only one voice”, and yet, the crackdown on Huang and Wang is exactly what diminishes and silences the different voices that call for social justice.\n\n## 3. \"Extension of Police Investigation\" is About to Expire\n\nAccording to the Law of Criminal Procedure, for cases with expected sentences of less than ten years, the police can extend the period of investigation and detention for up to five months, after which the case must be transferred to the public prosecution office with the indictment, case materials, and evidence (Articles 154, 156, 157). Huang and Wang were officially arrested on October 27, 2021. Their detention has been extended twice consecutively, and the \"extension of police investigation\" would officially expire on March 27, 2022 as it reaches its fifth month. We, friends of Huang & Wang, have no way of knowing whether the police will follow the legal procedure of completing the investigation of Huang and Wang's case and handing the case over to the public prosecution office by March 27, or whether the police will continue deploying delay tactics and scrounging up whatever terms they can abuse to extend the period of investigation. We will continue to monitor this.\n\n## 4. Support for Huang and Wang: Voices from the World\n\nAlthough the government is continuing to suppress civil society, to silence more activists through subpoenas and coercion, and even to strengthen online censorship to prevent the dissemination of actions and information in support of Huang and Wang, many friends and organizations are continuing to pay attention and support them. In addition to the solidarity from international media and human rights organizations, we also received significant support from friends both domestically and internationally in the form of joint signatures, postcards, and mask photos in the past six months. Including:\n\nFollowing Huang and Wang’s enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, International Federation of Journalists, Front Line Defenders, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and the EU Delegation to China expressed their support and concern through statements. In March 2022, Human Rights Now and International Service for Human Rights spoke at the United Nations Human Rights Council, calling on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to pay attention to the \"Huang and Wang\" case and demanding the Chinese government to release them.\n\nIn the UK, 55 feminist scholars and 83 members of the UK University and College Union (UCU) respectively initiated and participated in a joint signature, demanding that the Chinese government immediately release Huang and Wang; 112 Chevening scholars issued a joint statement expressing serious concern over the arbitrary detention and inability to visit the activists, and urged the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office and its Chevening Committee to speak out on the matter.\n\nNearly 100 friends from all over the world sent postcards to Huang and Wang, expressing their concern and blessings for them and protesting against the police illegality. In addition, supporters in London, Hong Kong, Taipei, the United Arab Emirates and other places wore masks of Huang and Wang to protest in various parts of the city, calling on the Chinese government to release the two.\n\nThese actions demonstrate the widespread anger and resentment that the Huang and Wang case has sparked. As friends of Huang and Wang, we always believe that all external solidarity actions will have a warning effect on the misbehavior of the police which will help improve the detention situations of Huang and Wang. In the long run, we continue to call on more domestic and international groups and individuals to join the action of solidarity with Huang and Wang and fight for their freedom.\n\n## 5. Appeals from Friends of Huang and Wang\nIt has been six months since we lost contact with our beloved friends Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. We can't imagine the torture and humiliation they are going through. Friends and family have been deeply worried about their physical and mental health. But we believe that Huang and Wang must still hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a crime, participating in #MeToo is not a crime, supporting workers is not a crime, and fighting for social justice should never be a crime!\n\nAs friends of Huang & Wang:\n\nWe strongly condemn the arbitrary detention and criminal charges of Huang and Wang by the Guangzhou authorities. We demand that the authorities immediately disclose the whereabouts of Huang and Wang and their physical and mental health conditions. The authorities must allow the lawyers to visit Huang and Wang, and release them unconditionally!\n\nWe are deeply disappointed by the continuous silence from the UK Chevening Committee and the University of Sussex during the enforced disappearance and arbitrary arrest of their affiliated scholar and student, Huang Xueqin. We call on the Chevening Scholarship Committee and university officials to actively express their concern on this matter and condemn the Chinese government's egregious repression of human rights defenders.\n\nWe are sincerely grateful to international NGOs, human rights organizations, media outlets and the global civil society community for their solidarity support to Huang and Wang. We believe, they would also very appreciate everyone's continued concern on the situations of human rights abuse in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.\n\nWe deeply wish all of Huang and Wang's friends and comrades in civil society who have been affected by this case to remain strong. Political repression will make us severely fearful, but only the unity and company of each other can keep us strong and free. This is also what Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing have been working on in their struggle.\n\nRelease Xueqin and Jianbing!\n\nTranslate: 坨\n\nProofread: Lola\n\nChinese version: https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/03/20/half_year/","source":"_posts/6months_statements.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Statement on the Six-month Enforced Disappearance and Arbitrary Detention\n  of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, From Friends\ndate: 2022-04-11T05:09:50.393Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/5a8oAbj.jpg\ncategories:\n  - 案件通报\ntags:\n  - English\n---\nUp until March 20, 2022, #MeToo activist and independent journalist, Huang Xueqin and labor rights advocate, Wang Jianbing (\"Huang & Wang\") have been arbitrarily detained for six months after disappearing.

Dr. Li Wenliang, the covid-19 whistleblower who died from the virus in Wuhan, once said, \"A healthy society should not have only one voice”, and yet, the crackdown on Huang and Wang is exactly what diminishes and silences the different voices that call for social justice.\n\n## 3. \"Extension of Police Investigation\" is About to Expire\n\nAccording to the Law of Criminal Procedure, for cases with expected sentences of less than ten years, the police can extend the period of investigation and detention for up to five months, after which the case must be transferred to the public prosecution office with the indictment, case materials, and evidence (Articles 154, 156, 157). Huang and Wang were officially arrested on October 27, 2021. Their detention has been extended twice consecutively, and the \"extension of police investigation\" would officially expire on March 27, 2022 as it reaches its fifth month. We, friends of Huang & Wang, have no way of knowing whether the police will follow the legal procedure of completing the investigation of Huang and Wang's case and handing the case over to the public prosecution office by March 27, or whether the police will continue deploying delay tactics and scrounging up whatever terms they can abuse to extend the period of investigation. We will continue to monitor this.\n\n## 4. Support for Huang and Wang: Voices from the World\n\nAlthough the government is continuing to suppress civil society, to silence more activists through subpoenas and coercion, and even to strengthen online censorship to prevent the dissemination of actions and information in support of Huang and Wang, many friends and organizations are continuing to pay attention and support them. In addition to the solidarity from international media and human rights organizations, we also received significant support from friends both domestically and internationally in the form of joint signatures, postcards, and mask photos in the past six months. Including:\n\nFollowing Huang and Wang’s enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, International Federation of Journalists, Front Line Defenders, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and the EU Delegation to China expressed their support and concern through statements. In March 2022, Human Rights Now and International Service for Human Rights spoke at the United Nations Human Rights Council, calling on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to pay attention to the \"Huang and Wang\" case and demanding the Chinese government to release them.\n\nIn the UK, 55 feminist scholars and 83 members of the UK University and College Union (UCU) respectively initiated and participated in a joint signature, demanding that the Chinese government immediately release Huang and Wang; 112 Chevening scholars issued a joint statement expressing serious concern over the arbitrary detention and inability to visit the activists, and urged the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office and its Chevening Committee to speak out on the matter.\n\nNearly 100 friends from all over the world sent postcards to Huang and Wang, expressing their concern and blessings for them and protesting against the police illegality. In addition, supporters in London, Hong Kong, Taipei, the United Arab Emirates and other places wore masks of Huang and Wang to protest in various parts of the city, calling on the Chinese government to release the two.\n\nThese actions demonstrate the widespread anger and resentment that the Huang and Wang case has sparked. As friends of Huang and Wang, we always believe that all external solidarity actions will have a warning effect on the misbehavior of the police which will help improve the detention situations of Huang and Wang. In the long run, we continue to call on more domestic and international groups and individuals to join the action of solidarity with Huang and Wang and fight for their freedom.\n\n## 5. Appeals from Friends of Huang and Wang\nIt has been six months since we lost contact with our beloved friends Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. We can't imagine the torture and humiliation they are going through. Friends and family have been deeply worried about their physical and mental health. But we believe that Huang and Wang must still hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a crime, participating in #MeToo is not a crime, supporting workers is not a crime, and fighting for social justice should never be a crime!\n\nAs friends of Huang & Wang:\n\nWe strongly condemn the arbitrary detention and criminal charges of Huang and Wang by the Guangzhou authorities. We demand that the authorities immediately disclose the whereabouts of Huang and Wang and their physical and mental health conditions. The authorities must allow the lawyers to visit Huang and Wang, and release them unconditionally!\n\nWe are deeply disappointed by the continuous silence from the UK Chevening Committee and the University of Sussex during the enforced disappearance and arbitrary arrest of their affiliated scholar and student, Huang Xueqin. We call on the Chevening Scholarship Committee and university officials to actively express their concern on this matter and condemn the Chinese government's egregious repression of human rights defenders.\n\nWe are sincerely grateful to international NGOs, human rights organizations, media outlets and the global civil society community for their solidarity support to Huang and Wang. We believe, they would also very appreciate everyone's continued concern on the situations of human rights abuse in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.\n\nWe deeply wish all of Huang and Wang's friends and comrades in civil society who have been affected by this case to remain strong. Political repression will make us severely fearful, but only the unity and company of each other can keep us strong and free. This is also what Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing have been working on in their struggle.\n\nRelease Xueqin and Jianbing!\n\nTranslate: 坨\n\nProofread: Lola\n\nChinese version: https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/03/20/half_year/","slug":"6months_statements","published":1,"updated":"2022-04-11T05:14:31.611Z","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl1u9gs6j0000y2k2bx8a4krb","content":"<p>Up until March 20, 2022, #MeToo activist and independent journalist, Huang Xueqin and labor rights advocate, Wang Jianbing (“Huang &amp; Wang”) have been arbitrarily detained for six months after disappearing. On September 19, 2021, the Guangzhou Police forcibly arrested Huang and Wang who were at a weekly gathering at Wang’s residence and placed them under residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL) on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. It was not until early November 2021 that Huang and Wang’s family members received a “notice of arrest” issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau. The notice showed that the pair were arrested with formal approval on October 27, and claimed that both of them were detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center.</p>\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5a8oAbj.jpg\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"1-Review-of-Huang-amp-Wang’s-half-year-detention\"><a href=\"#1-Review-of-Huang-amp-Wang’s-half-year-detention\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.

Since their disappearance on September 19, 2021, Huang and Wang’s family and friends had only indirectly learnt about the arrest through other friends who were summoned by police. Though required by law, a “notice of detention” was never sent to their family members after the arrest and it was not until the end of January 2021, four months after their disappearance, when their family members received the notice confirming that Huang and Wang were accused of ‘inciting subversion of state power’ and were placed in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center.</p>\n<p>However, we later learned that Huang Xueqin is in fact in Guangzhou No. 2 Detention Center, and whether Wang Jianbing is detained in the No. 1 Detention Center remains unknown. Their families and friends have tried several times over the past six months to send money to them. All attempts have failed, suggesting that the place of their detention on paper may not match the actual location or that they were detained under pseudonyms. We have no way of knowing the actual detention location or health situations of the pair.</p>\n<p>Since Huang and Wang’s arrest, the Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, have continued local or cross-regional subpoenas or interrogations. Around 70 of Huang and Wang’s friends have been summoned by the police for interrogation. Without following legal procedure, the Guangzhou police interrogated their friends for up to 24 hours, some even several times, and forcibly searched and copied their electronic devices. The police also forced and threatened some of Huang &amp; Wang’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police. This means they have intimidated Huang &amp; Wang to the point of admitting that they had participated in training activities that had the intention of “subverting state power” and fabricated the gathering at Jianbing’s apartment as a political event criticizing the government. In the past six months, the police have been using this way to manufacture illegal evidence to accuse Huang &amp; Wang.</p>\n<p>Both Huang &amp; Wang’s attorney visit requests were declined. Two of their families’ trusted attorneys currently represent Huang &amp; Wang. Since October 2021, even though Wang’s attorney Xiao Yunyang has continuously submitted applications to the Guangzhou police requesting meetings with Wang and bail, all requests have been declined on the grounds of “involving national security”. The legitimacy of Xiao’s attorney qualification was also questioned. Huang Xueqin’s attorney’s meeting requests in March 2022 were also declined.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-The-Arrest-of-Huang-amp-Wang-Indicates-a-Profound-Crackdown-on-Civil-Society-Networks-in-China\"><a href=\"#2-The-Arrest-of-Huang-amp-Wang-Indicates-a-Profound-Crackdown-on-Civil-Society-Networks-in-China\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2. The Arrest of Huang &amp; Wang Indicates a Profound Crackdown on Civil Society Networks in China\"></a>2. The Arrest of Huang &amp; Wang Indicates a Profound Crackdown on Civil Society Networks in China</h2><p>Since 2015, the Chinese government has been speeding up its effort to shrink and close its local civic space. Civil society organizations and activists concerned with women’s rights and labor rights have been subjected to crackdowns and criminal charges one after another. Following the mass political arrests such as the “Feminist Five’’, “709” Crackdown, and the “123” Labor Crackdown in 2015, as well as the Jasic Crackdown in 2018, the civil society networks in China have gradually become more and more fragmented, which has contributed to the looming fear over the activists. As a result of such dispiriting events, Huang &amp; Wang organized the weekly social gatherings in their own apartment as an attempt to encourage depondent activists who cared about social issues. However, these perfectly normal weekly gatherings were deemed a major threat on “national security” by the Chinese government, and Huang &amp; Wang were charged with the felony of “Inciting Subversion of State Power”.</p>\n<p>The Guangzhou police have repeatedly used “national security” as a reason to suppress civil society activities in the Huang &amp; Wang case.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The authorities viewed the gatherings at Wang’s place as an “activity” that threatened national security. However, the crackdown taken by the local authorities were themselves a violation of citizens’ freedom of speech and assembly, not to mention the gatherings were not created for discussing political issues, but were an informal network for young activists to support and keep each other company.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The arrest of Huang and Wang also indicates a further crackdown on the remaining civil society networks in China. This is especially true among feminist and labor activists, e.g. labor activists’ support for workers have been seen as a major threat to social stability by the authorities for years, and more recently gender issues have also been heavily politicized by the authorities in the wake of the #MeToo movement and the Peng Shuai case.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>After Huang and Wang’s arrest, the police refused to disclose any information about the two on the grounds of “national security”. Furthermore, police revealed in private that Huang and Wang were detained incommunicado and isolated, which suggests that the police might have abused RSDL (a UN expert-identified form of incommunicado detention). “National security” was also used by the police as an excuse to deny any meetings between Huang, Wang and their respective lawyers, which denies the pair their basic legal rights and denies the public its right to know.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Huang and Wang’s experience encapsulates the Chinese government’s deepening crackdown on its domestic civil society networks.

But we believe that Huang and Wang must still hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a crime, participating in #MeToo is not a crime, supporting workers is not a crime, and fighting for social justice should never be a crime!</p>\n<p>As friends of Huang &amp; Wang:</p>\n<p>We strongly condemn the arbitrary detention and criminal charges of Huang and Wang by the Guangzhou authorities. We demand that the authorities immediately disclose the whereabouts of Huang and Wang and their physical and mental health conditions. The authorities must allow the lawyers to visit Huang and Wang, and release them unconditionally!</p>\n<p>We are deeply disappointed by the continuous silence from the UK Chevening Committee and the University of Sussex during the enforced disappearance and arbitrary arrest of their affiliated scholar and student, Huang Xueqin. We call on the Chevening Scholarship Committee and university officials to actively express their concern on this matter and condemn the Chinese government’s egregious repression of human rights defenders.</p>\n<p>We are sincerely grateful to international NGOs, human rights organizations, media outlets and the global civil society community for their solidarity support to Huang and Wang. We believe, they would also very appreciate everyone’s continued concern on the situations of human rights abuse in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.</p>\n<p>We deeply wish all of Huang and Wang’s friends and comrades in civil society who have been affected by this case to remain strong. Political repression will make us severely fearful, but only the unity and company of each other can keep us strong and free. This is also what Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing have been working on in their struggle.</p>\n<p>Release Xueqin and Jianbing!</p>\n<p>Translate: 坨</p>\n<p>Proofread: Lola</p>\n<p>Chinese version: <a href=\"https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/03/20/half_year/\">https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/03/20/half_year/</a></p>"},{"layout":"post","title":"【案件更新】律师成功会见王建兵，王此前被单独隔离关押长达五个多月","date":"2022-04-10T21:19:19.526Z","cover":"https://i.imgur.com/kVmeZiB.png","_content":"最新消息：继3月27日 #黄雪琴 和 #王建兵 案（雪饼案）被正式移送 #广州市检察院 审查起诉后，4月1日，王的代理律师萧云阳终于被允许通过视频会见了关押在 #广州市第一看守所 的王建兵。据向王的亲友了解，这是建兵被任意羁押失联近200天后第一次与外界取得联系。萧律师4月6日于检察院进行了部分阅卷。黄雪琴律师迄今仍未成功会见和阅卷。\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n据了解，建兵是近一个月才正式被转到第一看守所关押，此前长达五个多月里则被关押到看守所之外的所谓“隔离区”，但实际为非法定场所，他在单独关押期间被长时间多次审讯，迄今无法知道具体地点。在会见时，建兵第一时间先主动询问了朋友们的信息，他十分关心大家的处境，在得知大多数人都没事后，他才放松下来。建兵表述，近一个月身体和精神状况才稍微转好，此前单独关押期间，饮食不规律、肠胃不好，且精神备受抑郁症折磨。雪琴的情况暂无法得知，估计与建兵类似，但上个月获知雪琴在关押半年期间体重骤减十斤（此前她已经很瘦了，不到50kg）。\n\n3月底，雪饼亲友发现，看守所系统终于可以查到雪饼两人的个人信息（这与两人上个月才被正式转到第一看守所情形相符，此前半年均查询失败），并可以进行网上汇款。亲友紧急给两人汇了生活费（限额500人民币/月），但半个月以来两人账户余额仍未有变动，很可能意味着两人还未能使用或无法使用账户上的汇款。他们两人在广州第一看守所的生活状况，令人担忧。\n\n本案中，雪饼两人因“组织日常聚会”而被控以“煽动颠覆国家政权”此莫须有的罪名，现已被任意羁押和失联长达半年之久，警方搜查和传唤公民社会行动者/关注者多达70人，意图捏造证据、编造“颠覆”的故事套在雪饼两人身上，雪饼亲友表示非常的愤怒和无法接受！我们希望雪饼两人转到看守所集体关押后，身心健康都能得到更好的保障。此外，我们要求广州当局能依法切实保障两人的合法权益，特别是两人与外界的通信权和律师会见阅卷权。\n\n（2022.4.11）\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kVmeZiB.png)","source":"_posts/meet_jianbing.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【案件更新】律师成功会见王建兵，王此前被单独隔离关押长达五个多月\ndate: 2022-04-11T05:19:19.526Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/kVmeZiB.png\ncategories:\n  -

While in detention, the pair were charged with inciting subversion of state power. Since then, their friends around the world have organized campaigns and actions to support them, starting petitions, sending postcards to them in jail and organizing demonstrations. \n\n> Here, Yaya and Tony, two activists in the global campaign group—one new to activism and one veteran organizer—share reflections on their work with the group and what it means for the future of Chinese social movements. As the movement in Hong Kong faces increasingly similar challenges, the lessons shared by these activists will no doubt help Hongkongers strengthen their movement, offer better solidarity to mainland allies and weather the storms to come.\n\n> Read more about Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing [here](https://lausan.hk/2022/free-huang-xueqin-and-wang-jianbing/). \n\n**Uchiyama:** What motivated you to become involved in the campaign to free Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing?\n\n**Yaya:** Xueqin’s experiences as a woman, as a journalist who reported on the #MeToo movement and other women’s issues in China, and finally as a student who was intending to come to the UK to study caught my attention. From the start, her case resonated with me because I believe the bond of solidarity with other feminists is very important. Then, as I started learning more about her case, I started to feel resentment about what the PRC government did to them so I decided to join the campaign to free Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. I wanted to try to do something for them.\n\n**Tony:** I have been a friend of both Xueqin and Jianbing for a long time and I was also a frequent attendee of their weekly gatherings. They would hold gatherings every week and I would attend at least three times a month. The government considered those gatherings to be illegal assemblies with so-called political purpose, which is why they were detained. I feel that it is my obligation and duty to support them, as their friend and as an activist as well. People like me who have many years experience of activism know how to deal with the fear of being targeted by the government, and we understand how the authorities work, so we can understand the risks better. So I feel that I am in a good position to stand up for them.\n\n**Uchiyama:** Has your work with the Free Xueqin and Jianbing group changed your perspective on the #MeToo and labor movements in the PRC, or elsewhere?\n\n**Yaya:** In the process of following their cases, I have understood more about the dangers and risks for activists in PRC. I feel that the political oppression they faced is getting closer and closer to me and the things I care about. That fear inspired me to respond more actively and take more responsibility to try and change this situation.\n\n**Tony:** Over the past ten years, half of my friends in civil society groups have been arrested. Like Xueqin and Jianbing, many of them are now in jail and it has become a normal, routine thing in my life to campaign for them. This is a reality that I need to accept—that in the PRC, civil society has broken down and that we cannot organize now the way we did before.\n\nPreviously I could work on migrant workers’ rights or other disadvantaged communities. But now, most of my time has been taken up by supporting my arrested friends. The government’s monitoring is very frequent and sometimes you would be told to report to the police every week to be questioned. Of course, dealing with that takes a lot of time. Because I spend so much time supporting my detained friends, I don’t have as much time to work on other issues—the issues that led me to get involved in civil society groups in the first place. \n\nCensorship online has become more difficult to work around too. In the past, messages of support for activists like Xueqin and Jianbing were shared on Weibo or WeChat. Now, however, this is no longer possible. People are more fearful than before, and it is hard to stay in touch with individuals and grassroots organizing generally. Being outside of China, we do not have to fear being censored in the same way. We have more freedom to speak out so it is our responsibility to coordinate and support the campaign. It is a strange kind of luck, because being overseas means we are also disconnected from the movement and the communities facing repression.\n\n**Uchiyama:** There are countless long-running campaigns in other states to free political prisoners. Are these movements connected to campaigns to free Chinese activists like Huang and Wang, and if so, how? \n\n**Yaya:** They are closely related. All these campaigns are fighting for the human rights of the most marginalized people. The circumstances that landed these political prisoners in jail are universal, and don’t only exist in one country. I think these cases, including Xueqin and Jianbing’s, could become the source of a solidarity to resist oppression by government authorities around the globe, together. So we have to be careful when these detentions are used by nationalist forces and media to spur bias and hate between people. \n\n**Tony:** When we talk about transnational campaigns as Chinese activists, we always think that we need other people’s help. In China, we can provide so little support to the global community—we are the ones asking for help. But transnational means that we help each other and engage with each other’s movements. Just like in other big countries, Chinese people are very China-centric. We do not have a very strong international perspective, so we do not have a proactive approach to connecting with other movements globally. It is also true that we have already spent so much energy to advocate local political issues that we do not have much left over to connect with international groups. \n\nThe kind of support we receive from international friends also depends on how much interest there is. For example, in the US, it is hard to get people to care about China, especially small figures who are detained. Many western activists ask me if our efforts overseas are actually useful. Many people here are hesitant to support us because they aren’t sure if supporting Chinese activists overseas is useful. We need to persuade them that what we are doing is useful. \n\nBut it is hard for us as activists to do so, especially when we don’t have any positive cases or successes to show them that their efforts pay off. In the west, activists have freedom of association, they can communicate with their elected representatives or they can launch protests or marches which will pressure elected officials. But these tactics cannot really be used to support Chinese activists. It is hard to pressure the Chinese government directly, and even if pressure was exerted from overseas, we’ve seen many times that the Chinese government simply does not care. Another concern westerners have about supporting Chinese movements is that they fear their Chinese comrades they associate with will be charged with being foreign agents. This is frustrating, because it puts Chinese activists in a corner. We want solidarity, but it is so hard for grassroots Chinese voices to be heard in the west.\n\n**Uchiyama:** How would you describe the treatment of Huang and Wang and activists such as yourself in western media? \n\n**Yaya:** First of all, I am glad for the attention we have gotten in some western media. But on the other hand, as campaigners, we also question their reporting methods and the relationship and interactions they have with the interviewee and other participants, especially when it comes to talking about China’s political issues. Often, western media come with stereotypes or they treat issues in China as a kind of spectacle, much in the same way they do war in the Middle East. This kind of perspective can potentially lead audiences to become numb or feel distanced from these issues, even when these issues are actually more universal and do not only affect Chinese people. It might raise nationalistic feelings or bias and hate against others which can lead to hate crimes against Asians and Muslims. \n\n**Tony:** The whole western world tries to characterize the Chinese government as an evil machine and Chinese people as their victims. So, when it comes to Chinese social movements, they are only interested in using these cases as evidence for how evil the Chinese government is. \n\nThis propaganda is very powerful. For example, when I came to the US, everyone told me how lucky I was to be out of China and how China is so scary. They said, “you can’t bring your phone or computer to the Winter Olympics,” or they would ask about the social credit score. I asked them, “if everything is so scary, why do you think I was very active in the social movement and how could I have survived there for so long without being attacked?” I did face some political attacks, of course, but not physical ones. Even then, the attacks were not as scary as I imagined, and most importantly, it reminded me that we the activists have the agency to fight and survive.\n\nThis is one reason why people do not think we have much power to control China’s fate or put pressure on our government. People outside of China think of us as victims, and they think, falsely, that there is no movement in China. Western media narratives simplify China’s government as an evil machine, and its people as robots who all share the same ideology. Of course, we also disagree with the government, but that does not mean that Chinese activists should be used as a tool by western media for its propaganda. On the other side of things, there are people who are only focused on fighting western imperialism. They use Chinese people in their arguments and steal our voices. In the west, it seems like the entire war is between people who think the Chinese government is an evil regime and people who think it is a paradise. Where is the space for the voices of Chinese activists? We need to hear more voices from the grassroots. \n\nThis is doubly hard because the censorship on Chinese social media means that there is no space for activists to survive. This is the same as in the west, especially when you are activists rather than academics, and if your English is not fluent. Relying on western media and intellectuals to speak up on our behalf is not ideal, either. In my personal interactions, I try to explain the difference between the government and its people to my western friends and the media. But it is frustrating when I see that they are simply using our struggles to push their own agenda. By ignoring the agency we have in China, people in the west lose the motivation to care about Chinese people, let alone try to support our movement or try to inform themselves properly about it.\n\n**Uchiyama:** How can feminists and labor activists outside of the PRC support their friends in the PRC? \n\n**Yaya:** I think the first thing is to pay attention to them and listen to them. Don’t pretend the elephant does not exist. In official propaganda especially, activists and related issues are more easily disappeared. Secondly, keep speaking out on social media or in your daily life, especially when some people are forced to be silent. Third, those of us who are overseas need to use the resources around us as much as possible. For example, we can use academia and the media to inform more people about cases like Xueqin and Jianbing’s, and encourage them to pay attention to feminism and labour issues. Last, I think it is important to build solidarity with different groups, whether they are feminists, labor activists, or environmental activists. Ultimately, we are all fighting for the same thing: to have a better future for everyone. We cannot watch the fire from the other side (隔岸观火) and pretend that we can be safe by choosing to be silent, obedient and isolated. We are entangled in this world.\n\n**Tony:** I consider our campaign [to free Xueqin and Jianbing] a means of leverage and education. But to support Chinese activists, it is important to first adjust our expectations about what is possible. You cannot use your expectations in the western world in the Chinese one. In the west, we wish that people will be released. But in China, we cannot expect that. We know that it is very difficult to persuade powerful people in government to react to pressure from Chinese people or the international community. Despite this, it is still important to support Chinese activists. \n\nAlthough we can’t expect them to be released or the most important people in government to care, on the local level things are different. Local authorities will know and people in their communities will remember them. If any harm comes to the detainees then the local authorities will be in trouble with the higher ups. So that protects them physically, if not psychologically, in prison. Even if they cannot be released earlier, at least they will not be beaten or tortured as much in detention. (Before 2010, activists were sometimes released earlier because of public pressure, but this is no longer the case.) \n\nThe other reason we should still support Chinese activists is to give the activists leverage to negotiate with their jailors. From my own experience in prison, I know that outside support can help boost your morale. Of course, prisoners will never receive the postcards their supporters send them, but the police do. Even though the postcards are addressed to our friends, we are really writing them for the police to read. In interrogations, the police might mention that there are many people outside, demonstrating for you or there might be a sudden, inexplicable improvement in your treatment. If, as a prisoner, you know that the police are worried about the publicity your case is getting, then you would be in a better position to negotiate for a shorter sentence or bargain for better treatment. Everything we do outside the detention centers is to give prisoners more leverage indirectly.\n\nFinally, when we continue to talk about Chinese activists, we allow the Chinese movement to be seen and we write its story. We remind the world and ourselves that there are still so many people fighting within China for justice. This is important because we are amplifying the voices of Chinese activists, but also because these activists can be inspirations for other movements. If these activists cannot be remembered domestically, then they need to be remembered internationally. \n\nThis remembrance is also a form of education. I believe more and more people in China will become activists in the future. Issues like workplace justice, the lack of protections for gig workers and the plight of students who face economic crises are major issues right now. When their consciousness is raised, they will need to learn the tactics for social movements from the activists now. Without efforts to document the history of Chinese social movements, there is no future for Chinese activism.\n\n[Source](https://lausan.hk/2022/campaigning-from-the-outside/)","source":"_posts/lausan2.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: \"【LAUSAN】Campaigning from the outside: Reflections from two Chinese activists\"\ndate: 2022-04-26T14:57:07.624Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/Mfl2D6m.png\ncategories:\n  - 媒体报道\ntags:\n  - English\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Mfl2D6m.png)\n\n> Interviewer’s note: The campaign to free the feminist activist and journalist Huang Xueqin and the labor campaigner Wang Jianbing has been ongoing since September 2021, when they were both detained for hosting gatherings to discuss current affairs.

This is a reality that I need to accept—that in the PRC, civil society has broken down and that we cannot organize now the way we did before.\n\nPreviously I could work on migrant workers’ rights or other disadvantaged communities. But now, most of my time has been taken up by supporting my arrested friends. The government’s monitoring is very frequent and sometimes you would be told to report to the police every week to be questioned. Of course, dealing with that takes a lot of time. Because I spend so much time supporting my detained friends, I don’t have as much time to work on other issues—the issues that led me to get involved in civil society groups in the first place. \n\nCensorship online has become more difficult to work around too. In the past, messages of support for activists like Xueqin and Jianbing were shared on Weibo or WeChat. Now, however, this is no longer possible. People are more fearful than before, and it is hard to stay in touch with individuals and grassroots organizing generally. Being outside of China, we do not have to fear being censored in the same way. We have more freedom to speak out so it is our responsibility to coordinate and support the campaign. It is a strange kind of luck, because being overseas means we are also disconnected from the movement and the communities facing repression.\n\n**Uchiyama:** There are countless long-running campaigns in other states to free political prisoners. Are these movements connected to campaigns to free Chinese activists like Huang and Wang, and if so, how? \n\n**Yaya:** They are closely related. All these campaigns are fighting for the human rights of the most marginalized people. The circumstances that landed these political prisoners in jail are universal, and don’t only exist in one country. I think these cases, including Xueqin and Jianbing’s, could become the source of a solidarity to resist oppression by government authorities around the globe, together. So we have to be careful when these detentions are used by nationalist forces and media to spur bias and hate between people. \n\n**Tony:** When we talk about transnational campaigns as Chinese activists, we always think that we need other people’s help. In China, we can provide so little support to the global community—we are the ones asking for help. But transnational means that we help each other and engage with each other’s movements. Just like in other big countries, Chinese people are very China-centric. We do not have a very strong international perspective, so we do not have a proactive approach to connecting with other movements globally. It is also true that we have already spent so much energy to advocate local political issues that we do not have much left over to connect with international groups. \n\nThe kind of support we receive from international friends also depends on how much interest there is. For example, in the US, it is hard to get people to care about China, especially small figures who are detained. Many western activists ask me if our efforts overseas are actually useful. Many people here are hesitant to support us because they aren’t sure if supporting Chinese activists overseas is useful. We need to persuade them that what we are doing is useful. \n\nBut it is hard for us as activists to do so, especially when we don’t have any positive cases or successes to show them that their efforts pay off. In the west, activists have freedom of association, they can communicate with their elected representatives or they can launch protests or marches which will pressure elected officials. But these tactics cannot really be used to support Chinese activists. It is hard to pressure the Chinese government directly, and even if pressure was exerted from overseas, we’ve seen many times that the Chinese government simply does not care. Another concern westerners have about supporting Chinese movements is that they fear their Chinese comrades they associate with will be charged with being foreign agents. This is frustrating, because it puts Chinese activists in a corner. We want solidarity, but it is so hard for grassroots Chinese voices to be heard in the west.\n\n**Uchiyama:** How would you describe the treatment of Huang and Wang and activists such as yourself in western media? \n\n**Yaya:** First of all, I am glad for the attention we have gotten in some western media. But on the other hand, as campaigners, we also question their reporting methods and the relationship and interactions they have with the interviewee and other participants, especially when it comes to talking about China’s political issues. Often, western media come with stereotypes or they treat issues in China as a kind of spectacle, much in the same way they do war in the Middle East. This kind of perspective can potentially lead audiences to become numb or feel distanced from these issues, even when these issues are actually more universal and do not only affect Chinese people. It might raise nationalistic feelings or bias and hate against others which can lead to hate crimes against Asians and Muslims. \n\n**Tony:** The whole western world tries to characterize the Chinese government as an evil machine and Chinese people as their victims. So, when it comes to Chinese social movements, they are only interested in using these cases as evidence for how evil the Chinese government is. \n\nThis propaganda is very powerful. For example, when I came to the US, everyone told me how lucky I was to be out of China and how China is so scary. They said, “you can’t bring your phone or computer to the Winter Olympics,” or they would ask about the social credit score. I asked them, “if everything is so scary, why do you think I was very active in the social movement and how could I have survived there for so long without being attacked?” I did face some political attacks, of course, but not physical ones. Even then, the attacks were not as scary as I imagined, and most importantly, it reminded me that we the activists have the agency to fight and survive.\n\nThis is one reason why people do not think we have much power to control China’s fate or put pressure on our government. People outside of China think of us as victims, and they think, falsely, that there is no movement in China. Western media narratives simplify China’s government as an evil machine, and its people as robots who all share the same ideology. Of course, we also disagree with the government, but that does not mean that Chinese activists should be used as a tool by western media for its propaganda. On the other side of things, there are people who are only focused on fighting western imperialism. They use Chinese people in their arguments and steal our voices. In the west, it seems like the entire war is between people who think the Chinese government is an evil regime and people who think it is a paradise. Where is the space for the voices of Chinese activists? We need to hear more voices from the grassroots. \n\nThis is doubly hard because the censorship on Chinese social media means that there is no space for activists to survive. This is the same as in the west, especially when you are activists rather than academics, and if your English is not fluent. Relying on western media and intellectuals to speak up on our behalf is not ideal, either. In my personal interactions, I try to explain the difference between the government and its people to my western friends and the media. But it is frustrating when I see that they are simply using our struggles to push their own agenda. By ignoring the agency we have in China, people in the west lose the motivation to care about Chinese people, let alone try to support our movement or try to inform themselves properly about it.\n\n**Uchiyama:** How can feminists and labor activists outside of the PRC support their friends in the PRC? \n\n**Yaya:** I think the first thing is to pay attention to them and listen to them. Don’t pretend the elephant does not exist. In official propaganda especially, activists and related issues are more easily disappeared. Secondly, keep speaking out on social media or in your daily life, especially when some people are forced to be silent. Third, those of us who are overseas need to use the resources around us as much as possible. For example, we can use academia and the media to inform more people about cases like Xueqin and Jianbing’s, and encourage them to pay attention to feminism and labour issues. Last, I think it is important to build solidarity with different groups, whether they are feminists, labor activists, or environmental activists. Ultimately, we are all fighting for the same thing: to have a better future for everyone. We cannot watch the fire from the other side (隔岸观火) and pretend that we can be safe by choosing to be silent, obedient and isolated. We are entangled in this world.\n\n**Tony:** I consider our campaign [to free Xueqin and Jianbing] a means of leverage and education. But to support Chinese activists, it is important to first adjust our expectations about what is possible. You cannot use your expectations in the western world in the Chinese one. In the west, we wish that people will be released. But in China, we cannot expect that. We know that it is very difficult to persuade powerful people in government to react to pressure from Chinese people or the international community. Despite this, it is still important to support Chinese activists. \n\nAlthough we can’t expect them to be released or the most important people in government to care, on the local level things are different. Local authorities will know and people in their communities will remember them. If any harm comes to the detainees then the local authorities will be in trouble with the higher ups. So that protects them physically, if not psychologically, in prison. Even if they cannot be released earlier, at least they will not be beaten or tortured as much in detention. (Before 2010, activists were sometimes released earlier because of public pressure, but this is no longer the case.) \n\nThe other reason we should still support Chinese activists is to give the activists leverage to negotiate with their jailors. From my own experience in prison, I know that outside support can help boost your morale. Of course, prisoners will never receive the postcards their supporters send them, but the police do. Even though the postcards are addressed to our friends, we are really writing them for the police to read. In interrogations, the police might mention that there are many people outside, demonstrating for you or there might be a sudden, inexplicable improvement in your treatment. If, as a prisoner, you know that the police are worried about the publicity your case is getting, then you would be in a better position to negotiate for a shorter sentence or bargain for better treatment. Everything we do outside the detention centers is to give prisoners more leverage indirectly.\n\nFinally, when we continue to talk about Chinese activists, we allow the Chinese movement to be seen and we write its story. We remind the world and ourselves that there are still so many people fighting within China for justice. This is important because we are amplifying the voices of Chinese activists, but also because these activists can be inspirations for other movements. If these activists cannot be remembered domestically, then they need to be remembered internationally. \n\nThis remembrance is also a form of education. I believe more and more people in China will become activists in the future. Issues like workplace justice, the lack of protections for gig workers and the plight of students who face economic crises are major issues right now. When their consciousness is raised, they will need to learn the tactics for social movements from the activists now. Without efforts to document the history of Chinese social movements, there is no future for Chinese activism.\n\n[Source](https://lausan.hk/2022/campaigning-from-the-outside/)","slug":"lausan2","published":1,"updated":"2022-04-26T15:07:04.263Z","_id":"cl2ga3tgk0000jck22chn9mx1","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mfl2D6m.png\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interviewer’s note: The campaign to free the feminist activist and journalist Huang Xueqin and the labor campaigner Wang Jianbing has been ongoing since September 2021, when they were both detained for hosting gatherings to discuss current affairs.

Many people here are hesitant to support us because they aren’t sure if supporting Chinese activists overseas is useful. We need to persuade them that what we are doing is useful. </p>\n<p>But it is hard for us as activists to do so, especially when we don’t have any positive cases or successes to show them that their efforts pay off. In the west, activists have freedom of association, they can communicate with their elected representatives or they can launch protests or marches which will pressure elected officials. But these tactics cannot really be used to support Chinese activists. It is hard to pressure the Chinese government directly, and even if pressure was exerted from overseas, we’ve seen many times that the Chinese government simply does not care. Another concern westerners have about supporting Chinese movements is that they fear their Chinese comrades they associate with will be charged with being foreign agents. This is frustrating, because it puts Chinese activists in a corner. We want solidarity, but it is so hard for grassroots Chinese voices to be heard in the west.</p>\n<p><strong>Uchiyama:</strong> How would you describe the treatment of Huang and Wang and activists such as yourself in western media? </p>\n<p><strong>Yaya:</strong> First of all, I am glad for the attention we have gotten in some western media. But on the other hand, as campaigners, we also question their reporting methods and the relationship and interactions they have with the interviewee and other participants, especially when it comes to talking about China’s political issues. Often, western media come with stereotypes or they treat issues in China as a kind of spectacle, much in the same way they do war in the Middle East. This kind of perspective can potentially lead audiences to become numb or feel distanced from these issues, even when these issues are actually more universal and do not only affect Chinese people. It might raise nationalistic feelings or bias and hate against others which can lead to hate crimes against Asians and Muslims. </p>\n<p><strong>Tony:</strong> The whole western world tries to characterize the Chinese government as an evil machine and Chinese people as their victims. So, when it comes to Chinese social movements, they are only interested in using these cases as evidence for how evil the Chinese government is. </p>\n<p>This propaganda is very powerful. For example, when I came to the US, everyone told me how lucky I was to be out of China and how China is so scary. They said, “you can’t bring your phone or computer to the Winter Olympics,” or they would ask about the social credit score. I asked them, “if everything is so scary, why do you think I was very active in the social movement and how could I have survived there for so long without being attacked?” I did face some political attacks, of course, but not physical ones. Even then, the attacks were not as scary as I imagined, and most importantly, it reminded me that we the activists have the agency to fight and survive.</p>\n<p>This is one reason why people do not think we have much power to control China’s fate or put pressure on our government. People outside of China think of us as victims, and they think, falsely, that there is no movement in China. Western media narratives simplify China’s government as an evil machine, and its people as robots who all share the same ideology. Of course, we also disagree with the government, but that does not mean that Chinese activists should be used as a tool by western media for its propaganda. On the other side of things, there are people who are only focused on fighting western imperialism. They use Chinese people in their arguments and steal our voices. In the west, it seems like the entire war is between people who think the Chinese government is an evil regime and people who think it is a paradise. Where is the space for the voices of Chinese activists? We need to hear more voices from the grassroots. </p>\n<p>This is doubly hard because the censorship on Chinese social media means that there is no space for activists to survive. This is the same as in the west, especially when you are activists rather than academics, and if your English is not fluent. Relying on western media and intellectuals to speak up on our behalf is not ideal, either. In my personal interactions, I try to explain the difference between the government and its people to my western friends and the media. But it is frustrating when I see that they are simply using our struggles to push their own agenda. By ignoring the agency we have in China, people in the west lose the motivation to care about Chinese people, let alone try to support our movement or try to inform themselves properly about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Uchiyama:</strong> How can feminists and labor activists outside of the PRC support their friends in the PRC? </p>\n<p><strong>Yaya:</strong> I think the first thing is to pay attention to them and listen to them. Don’t pretend the elephant does not exist. In official propaganda especially, activists and related issues are more easily disappeared. Secondly, keep speaking out on social media or in your daily life, especially when some people are forced to be silent. Third, those of us who are overseas need to use the resources around us as much as possible. For example, we can use academia and the media to inform more people about cases like Xueqin and Jianbing’s, and encourage them to pay attention to feminism and labour issues. Last, I think it is important to build solidarity with different groups, whether they are feminists, labor activists, or environmental activists. Ultimately, we are all fighting for the same thing: to have a better future for everyone. We cannot watch the fire from the other side (隔岸观火) and pretend that we can be safe by choosing to be silent, obedient and isolated. We are entangled in this world.</p>\n<p><strong>Tony:</strong> I consider our campaign [to free Xueqin and Jianbing] a means of leverage and education. But to support Chinese activists, it is important to first adjust our expectations about what is possible. You cannot use your expectations in the western world in the Chinese one. In the west, we wish that people will be released. But in China, we cannot expect that. We know that it is very difficult to persuade powerful people in government to react to pressure from Chinese people or the international community. Despite this, it is still important to support Chinese activists. </p>\n<p>Although we can’t expect them to be released or the most important people in government to care, on the local level things are different. Local authorities will know and people in their communities will remember them. If any harm comes to the detainees then the local authorities will be in trouble with the higher ups. So that protects them physically, if not psychologically, in prison. Even if they cannot be released earlier, at least they will not be beaten or tortured as much in detention. (Before 2010, activists were sometimes released earlier because of public pressure, but this is no longer the case.) </p>\n<p>The other reason we should still support Chinese activists is to give the activists leverage to negotiate with their jailors. From my own experience in prison, I know that outside support can help boost your morale. Of course, prisoners will never receive the postcards their supporters send them, but the police do. Even though the postcards are addressed to our friends, we are really writing them for the police to read. In interrogations, the police might mention that there are many people outside, demonstrating for you or there might be a sudden, inexplicable improvement in your treatment. If, as a prisoner, you know that the police are worried about the publicity your case is getting, then you would be in a better position to negotiate for a shorter sentence or bargain for better treatment. Everything we do outside the detention centers is to give prisoners more leverage indirectly.</p>\n<p>Finally, when we continue to talk about Chinese activists, we allow the Chinese movement to be seen and we write its story. We remind the world and ourselves that there are still so many people fighting within China for justice. This is important because we are amplifying the voices of Chinese activists, but also because these activists can be inspirations for other movements. If these activists cannot be remembered domestically, then they need to be remembered internationally. </p>\n<p>This remembrance is also a form of education. I believe more and more people in China will become activists in the future. Issues like workplace justice, the lack of protections for gig workers and the plight of students who face economic crises are major issues right now. When their consciousness is raised, they will need to learn the tactics for social movements from the activists now. Without efforts to document the history of Chinese social movements, there is no future for Chinese activism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lausan.hk/2022/campaigning-from-the-outside/\">Source</a></p>\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"【问卷调查】与雪饼同在，分享你的“喝茶”体验","date":"2022-04-26T21:51:53.250Z","cover":"https://i.imgur.com/eQGlkWS.png","_content":"![](https://i.imgur.com/eQGlkWS.png)\n\n> 今天（4/27）是雪饼被警察带走的整整220天，我们发起了“喝茶”体验调查活动。我们希望通过这个略带诙谐与讽刺的小小的问卷写出彼此共同的“喝茶”经验，让大家看到更多的联结和支持，让“喝茶”见光，也让雪饼可以盼得自由。\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n问卷链接：https://www.surveycake.com/s/ry62a\n\n还记得与雪饼（黄雪琴、王建兵）聊天，谈的最频繁最有趣的就是“被喝茶”的经历：雪琴会同仇敌忾，对恶者不屑投以一丝客气，煎饼则是佛系泯然，但为遭遇者分外心疼。她他们把“喝茶”当成日常，淡化自己的压抑，但这终究是一种来自XX的暴力——她他们把最大的关心都给了身边的小伙伴，陪伴和鼓励这些失落、无助、甚至身缠恐惧与抑郁的行动者。\n\n消失的七个多月里，她他们必然也遭遇了200+天的日夜“喝茶”。我们必然难以同理她他们在里面遭受的“见不得光”的非人遭遇，但讲述本身就是力量，就是联结。此时此刻，雪饼纵然没有自由可以讲述这些故事，但我们可以代替她们讲述这些共同的体验，让“喝茶”见光，也让雪饼可以盼得自由。\n\n我们邀请每一位曾经喝过茶的小伙伴、行动路上的朋友，像雪饼一样，勇敢的分享你的遭遇，表达对“喝茶客服”的满意评价，与雪饼同在。\n\nby 一群黄雪琴、王建兵的朋友\n\n\\* 请依据您的个人状况与意愿填写。填写时，你可以以最近一次的喝茶经历或者印象最深的一次作为填写依据。我们将于活动结束后删除所有原始资料，确保大家安全。","source":"_posts/hecha.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【问卷调查】与雪饼同在，分享你的“喝茶”体验\ndate: 2022-04-27T05:51:53.250Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/eQGlkWS.png\ncategories:\n  -

Fu）告诉BBC，北京当局对公民社会的镇压越来越严厉，黄雪琴的案子“象征着”中国维权人士所面临的挑战。</p>\n<p>“政府将#MeToo运动视为倡导自由民主价值观的跨国运动的一部分，”黛安娜·傅说，“政府认为这种激进主义不仅是一种（社会）动员威胁，也是一种意识形态威胁。”</p>\n<p>据支持者和学者称，许多像黄雪琴和王建兵这样倡导性别权利和其他社会事业的活动人士，被诬陷为西方敌对势力的代理人，并在网上受到民族主义者的攻击。</p>\n<p>“在中国互联网上，你很难区分一个中国官方的网络评论员和一个普通网民，”现居美国的微博前审查员刘力朋在接受BBC采访时说。</p>\n<p>刘力朋在2011年至2013年期间帮助删除网络平台上的“敏感”内容，每天审查多达6万条帖子。他说中国当局已经开始对黄雪琴进行抹黑宣传。</p>\n<p>“黄雪琴是一位很著名的记者。如果你想要把她之前的一切全部抹掉的话，这是一个很难的措施。”刘立鹏说。 “（相反），中国使用宣传力量来针对黄雪琴。想要污名化她，想把她这个人塑造成另一个形象。这是一个可怕的现象。”</p>\n<p>微博没有回应BBC的置评请求。</p>\n<p>中国驻英国大使馆告诉BBC，中国“致力于维护社会公平和正义”，“坚决反对任何人以维护人权和自由为名，散布虚假信息和诽谤中国”。</p>\n<p>随着黄雪琴和王建兵的案件正在移交给中国的检察当局，克里斯和其他海外支持者计划继续呼吁国际社会关注他们两人所处困境。</p>\n<p>“在中国境内或境外，就像在墙内或墙外。但在外面并不意味着你是自由的，”克里斯说。“只有当他们获得自由时，我们才能真正获得自由。”</p>\n<p><a

more -->\n\n今天晚上，我发呆了一整晚，直到晚上11点才开始动笔。从白天开始，我就在想着写下这封信，但我时刻害怕书写你们的名字，用这种方式来记录你们失去自由的事实。事实上，这封信我花了整整八个月，都没有勇气开始写下一个字，直到今天。\n\n当我在11月5日的时候，真真切切看到你们的名字真实地印在“逮捕通知书”，在那么一刻，我才真的相信，或者说让自己死心，你们真的失去自由了。S问我，“有没有纸质证明对我而言这么重要吗？”。很重要。我不太会那么容易接受残酷的现实。煎饼你应该是最知道我的这种执着。\n\n我该怎么消化你们的消失？\n\n在你们消失后的两天，是中秋节。我去一个高层的天台上参加朋友的一个中秋聚餐。所以又聊起了你们。我只能泛泛地谈起你们的事情。可是当我站在天台边缘，吹着秋夜的风，我肉体充斥着诺大的苦痛——那是一种从内心的痛外溢到肉体的痛。我的内心已经无法容纳、消化这般苦痛。我捂着胸口，下意识地往后退了好几步，深呼吸。我害怕我会用一个简单的方式来解决我这种肉体的苦痛。这个记忆仍然存在我的身体，那种外溢的、难以喘息的、更难以释放的痛苦。这是我们这代人的苦痛。\n\n我不想再理性地去讨论为什么要抓你们。虽然我知道讨论你们的消失，本身就是一种很重要的对抗。充满浪漫理想主义的雪琴，你一定会痛斥这个残暴的体制，你一定知道我们所有的遭遇都在揭露整个国家机器对于社会公义的压制，而讨论本身就是一种教育。煎饼，你常会嘲讽自己其实已经躺平，可你亦不甘、不忍看到霸权体制下对于人性的扭曲和社会的变质腐烂。所有的这些，都在道出打压你们的这一切的荒诞。\n\n可我不愿再重复论述这无力的一切。我并不恐惧这一切的荒诞和残暴，但我恐惧的是暴戾背后对你们真实肉体的伤害和摧残。即便我们说太多遍、谴责无数次这样的滥捕套罪，都不能够抵消在你们身上正在发生的所有创伤和折磨，不可逆的伤害。我恐惧看到不一样的你们——不是担心被改造，我不觉得有任何折磨可以来摧毁你们对于公义的追求，而是失去滋养的枯萎的你们。\n\n我接受不了这样的残忍。雪琴，一次又一次的读书机会从你身上被剥夺。第一次，你不得不回到大陆才能申请香港签证，却因此进入了一个设计好的笼子当中，在第二次求学，国宝信信旦旦让你拿回护照申请英国签证，让我们都觉得在低调的妥协之下可以得以自由，殊不知这又是另一个陷阱。煎饼，你我的出身背景如此相似，我们走出农村来到城市，我们不愿意看到身上承载的阶级不公继续延续下去，然而回应工人/社会议题最后带给你的却是如此代价。我不能理解，我无法接受。长年抑郁症的你，还要经受怎样的折磨。我可以想象得到里面会发生的一切的羞辱，你们要如何才能扛得下来？\n\n有很多情感我不再能够表达出来，可能也失去了表达的能力了。我将对你们的思念都久久地封锁起来了，因为一旦开始闪现你们的身影，那尘封的痛苦也将会一并被揭开。我不敢面对这些。我也不再打麻将，不再敢轻易提到周四，不再能够开心。我们几个人从来没有一次真的深入去聊彼此的人生，但是我们都能意会，彼此在何方。有一些东西系着我们这代人。\n\n去年的这一天，是你们为我庆祝农历的生日，估计那是我过去三十年唯一正式过的一个生日。我没有什么过生日的传统，但那个生日我们都称是“捡到”的——那段忐忑的日子，国宝在背后对我搞小动作，我也永远不知道哪天清晨醒来还能够从容地拉开窗帘。我或许有恐惧，但至少“打麻将”成了我们彼此的支持。每一个人“29岁”都有一个坎，没想到我的那一年迎接的是你们的消失。\n\n雪琴用蜡烛画了我“29”岁的标记，给我绑上了“斗争”的红绑带，煎饼改造了蛋糕盒硬扣我头上做寿星帽。你们当时都让我许愿。但我从来没有许愿的经验，我也不信许愿这回事，所以就只能假装闭眼动一动嘴角，其实我啥都没许。可是我后悔了，我应该要许愿的——我想要你们俩人好好的，雪琴可以顺利去英国读书，煎饼可以在抑郁的雾霾之下睡得好一点。我只想要这么简单的愿望，但我错过了。\n\n2021年9月19日那天的下午1点41分，那是我最后一次跟煎饼聊天，我问他，“你这几天睡得好吗？”，煎饼回了我，“不知道。可能四年一次的抑郁是躲不过了。”我错过了你这条回复。等到我想起来回复的时候，第二天才发现怎么都联系不到你和雪琴，了无踪迹。自此，你们消失了整整八个月，八个月了。我感觉我跟你们一样，也错过了整整八个月的时光，甚至有时候都想不起来这期间世界已经发生了什么变化。\n\n我的一个农历年又过去了。我回归了把每一个生日当成普通时间来过的日子。但这一次，我想许个愿，把去年错过的愿望补上——你们俩人好好的，啥时候出来，我们的麻将还要继续打。我今天也给你们又汇了生活费，我也希望你们真的能够收到、能够花上，等你们出来了再来还我。\n\n煎饼、雪琴，我们都在想着你们。即便网络上几乎找不到你们的痕迹，你们不会被忘记。\n\n来源：祥子\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YsJOFNE.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Lo5nyHp.png)","source":"_posts/520letter.md","raw":"---\nlayout:

米歇尔·巴切莱特女士：\n\n我們是中國女權人士暨獨立記者黃雪琴以及中國職業病權利倡導者王建兵的朋友，自從他們於2021年9月19日下午被強迫失蹤和廣州當局任意羈押開始，我們便利用自己有限的時間、能力與精神，持續關注他們的狀況。\n\n令人遺憾的是，我們即便身處監獄牆外的世界，卻並不感到安全和自由；相反地，由於害怕受到中國當局報復性的迫害，我們僅能選擇以匿名的方式發表這封公開信。懇請您意識到：不論是身處監獄之內的黃雪琴和王建兵，或者居於監獄牆外的我們，在中國，實踐這些揭示於世界人權宣言中的言論自由、集會與結社自由等基本人權的代價，就是牢獄之災以及與愛別離。\n\n黃雪琴與王建兵兩人因在家中組織每週聚會分享觀點，支持破碎和備受打壓的中國公民社會社群，這些踐行世界人權宣言中的言論自由、集會與結社自由的基本行為卻被中國政府定義為「煽動顛覆國家政權」的嚴重犯罪。我們對此感到非常憤怒和難以接受。黃雪琴與王建兵自2021年9月19日被捕失聯至今，已近250天。其中，黃雪琴甚至至今被禁止律師會見與家屬探視，使得她被完全與外界隔絕，因此我們無從得知她的身心現況；王建兵的律師在今年4月1日首次也是唯一一次視頻會見到王建兵。\n\n這樣的會見並不意味著中國政府遵循法治。很遺憾，我們從家屬所了解的消息中得知，王建兵被以「疫情隔離」為由單獨關押長達五個月的時間，其間歷經數十次的疲勞審訊、飲食不規律，王建兵正深受憂鬱症、腸胃問題與酷刑所苦。從過往的經驗看來，我們相信黃雪琴的狀況不會與王建兵的處境有太大差異。\n\n這是個令人極度擔憂的消息。因為黃雪琴與王建兵的個案現況，很可能顯示出中國政府正積極的利用「新冠疫情」等名義，嘗試發明與開創新的打壓形式，以規避聯合國和國際社群針對「指定居所監視居住」的關注與批評。\n\n中國政府長期使用「指定居所監視居住（指監，RSDL）」強制措施，打壓異議人士和民間公益人士。根據保護衛士(Safeguard

Jianbing","date":"2022-05-23T20:42:45.306Z","cover":"https://i.imgur.com/MQKYoNp.png","_content":"Dear High Commissioner, Ms. Bachelet:\n\nWe are writing to express our worries and demands on the case of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. At a time when human rights defenders in China face strong hostility and reprisals from the Chinese government, we urge you to avoid your China visit become complicit of the propaganda Chinese government. We sincerely call on your visit to Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing in person in Guangzhou. \n\nWe are friends of Huang Xueqin, a Chinese feminist and independent journalist who had been arrested once in 2019, and Wang Jianbing, a Chinese occupational disease rights advocate. Since their enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention by the Guangzhou authorities on September 19, 2021, we have taken our limited time and ability to follow up and promote this case.\n\nRegrettably, even in the world outside the prison walls, we do not feel safe and free; on the contrary, we can only release this open letter to you and the world anonymously for fear of reprisals by the Chinese authorities. I wish you to aware and realize that whether it is Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing who are inside the prison, or we who live outside the prison walls, in China, the price is jail time and separation from love when one practices the fundamental human rights such as the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association, which are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nHuang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing organized weekly gatherings at home to share their insights with the community and they support the fragmented and repressed civil society of China. These practice of freedom of speech, assembly and association elaborated in the UDHR are deemed as \"inciting subversion of state power\" by the Chinese authorities. We are extremely angry and we reject to accept this accusation.\n\nIt has been nearly 250 days since Huang and Wang were arrested and lost contact on September 19, 2021. Among them, Huang Xueqin has been banned from meeting with lawyers and family members, making her completely isolated from the outside world, so we have no way of knowing her physical and mental status. She remains incommunicado until today. Wang Jianbing’s lawyer met Wang for the first and only time online on April 1 this year.\n\nSuch online meeting does not mean that the Chinese government follows the rule of law. Regrettably, we learned from the information of the family that Wang Jianbing was held in solitary confinement for five months on the grounds of \"Covid-19 quarantine\". Wang Jianbing is suffered from depression, gastrointestinal problems and torture. Based on the past experience, we believe that Huang Xueqin's situation will not be much different from Wang Jianbing's situation.\n\nThis is extremely worrying news to not only us but the world. The current situation of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing's cases is likely to demonstrate that the Chinese government is actively using the \"Covid-19\" and other names to try to invent and create new forms of suppression, in order to avoid the United Nations and the international community's attention and criticism to \"residential surveillance in designated places (RSDL)”.\n\n\nThe Chinese government has long used “residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL)”, a form of solitary confinement, to suppress political dissidents and NGO activists. According to a report released by Safeguard Defenders in 2021, during the at most six-month RSDL, tortures such as sleep deprivation, abdominal beating, extended and tiring interrogations, and forcing the individual to sit on a tiger chair or dangling stool can be used to force the dissident to confess. Ten UN special procedures, including the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, have described the RSDL as “similar to isolation and secret detention”, equivalent to enforced disappearances. The Chinese government has drawn international criticism for this.\n\nIn the case of our friends Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, we also learned that the police held Wang in solitary confinement and interrogation for at least five months in the name of “pandemic isolation”. The de facto confinement of Huang and Wang are no different from the actual situation of the RSDL. However, by using the ground of “pandemic isolation”, the Chinese authorities have effectively circumvented the use of the terminology of the much-criticized “RSDL” measure on legal paper.\n\nWe strongly and fervently urge you and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to directly express your concern for the solitary confinement conditions of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, and their physical and mental health, when you visit China and the city of Guangzhou. We call on you to:\n\n1.\tCome to the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center to meet the detained human rights defenders Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. Please conduct in-depth inquiries about the solitary confinement and series of torture they have been subjected to in the past period, and express your gravely concern about their physical and mental health.\n2.\tPressure the Chinese authority to release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing immediately and drop the illegal charges. Also, please demand the Chinese government and the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center to arrange meeting for Huang and Wang to meet with their families and lawyers in person in accordance with the law, and to assure their lawyer's right to review the prosecution document. \n3.\tDemand the Chinese government and the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center to provide the two with adequate health treatment and a comprehensive physical examination, especially for Wang Jianbing's digestive disfunction and mental disorder.\n\nOur anxious hearts are with Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. At the same time, we are here to appeal, on behalf of all Chinese human rights defenders who have been deprived of their liberty for practicing basic human rights, and urge the UN Human Rights Office to continue and proactively pay attention to the repressive conditions of Chinese human rights defenders, and urge the Chinese government to stop abusing human rights. Ms. Bachelet, don’t let your trip become another form of political propaganda for the Chinese government, and don't let down Chinese human rights defenders who are imprisoned and who are still actively speaking out while facing tremendous risk.\n\nAs the UN high commissioner for human rights, you play a vital role in the world human rights movement. And we implore and urge you, when you visit Xinjiang during this trip to learn about one of the greatest human rights violations of the century, to remember that in China, those who voice out for the human rights and freedoms of others have also been held in the brutal China’s prisons.\n\nFriends of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, May 24, 2022\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MQKYoNp.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fNXF3AI.png)","source":"_posts/callUNHR-en.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Open Letter to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from Friends of\n  Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing\ndate: 2022-05-24T04:42:45.306Z\ncover: https://i.imgur.com/MQKYoNp.png\ncategories:\n  - 雪饼的朋友心声\ntags:\n  - English\n---\nDear High Commissioner, Ms. Bachelet:\n\nWe are writing to express our worries and demands on the case of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.

At a time when human rights defenders in China face strong hostility and reprisals from the Chinese government, we urge you to avoid your China visit become complicit of the propaganda Chinese government. We sincerely call on your visit to Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing in person in Guangzhou. </p>\n<p>We are friends of Huang Xueqin, a Chinese feminist and independent journalist who had been arrested once in 2019, and Wang Jianbing, a Chinese occupational disease rights advocate. Since their enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention by the Guangzhou authorities on September 19, 2021, we have taken our limited time and ability to follow up and promote this case.</p>\n<p>Regrettably, even in the world outside the prison walls, we do not feel safe and free; on the contrary, we can only release this open letter to you and the world anonymously for fear of reprisals by the Chinese authorities. I wish you to aware and realize that whether it is Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing who are inside the prison, or we who live outside the prison walls, in China, the price is jail time and separation from love when one practices the fundamental human rights such as the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association, which are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>\n<p>Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing organized weekly gatherings at home to share their insights with the community and they support the fragmented and repressed civil society of China. These practice of freedom of speech, assembly and association elaborated in the UDHR are deemed as “inciting subversion of state power” by the Chinese authorities. We are extremely angry and we reject to accept this accusation.</p>\n<p>It has been nearly 250 days since Huang and Wang were arrested and lost contact on September 19, 2021. Among them, Huang Xueqin has been banned from meeting with lawyers and family members, making her completely isolated from the outside world, so we have no way of knowing her physical and mental status. She remains incommunicado until today. Wang Jianbing’s lawyer met Wang for the first and only time online on April 1 this year.</p>\n<p>Such online meeting does not mean that the Chinese government follows the rule of law. Regrettably, we learned from the information of the family that Wang Jianbing was held in solitary confinement for five months on the grounds of “Covid-19 quarantine”. Wang Jianbing is suffered from depression, gastrointestinal problems and torture. Based on the past experience, we believe that Huang Xueqin’s situation will not be much different from Wang Jianbing’s situation.</p>\n<p>This is extremely worrying news to not only us but the world. The current situation of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing’s cases is likely to demonstrate that the Chinese government is actively using the “Covid-19” and other names to try to invent and create new forms of suppression, in order to avoid the United Nations and the international community’s attention and criticism to “residential surveillance in designated places (RSDL)”.</p>\n<p>The Chinese government has long used “residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL)”, a form of solitary confinement, to suppress political dissidents and NGO activists.

(Obtained by The Washington Post)</center>\n\nHuman rights activists were critical of a visit last week by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to China, where she made only cautious criticism of a mass internment campaign in Xinjiang. Supporters of Huang and Wang voiced frustration that Bachelet spoke at Guangzhou University, mere minutes from where Wang used to live, and praised the “movements and actions of young people challenging discrimination, injustice and inequalities” but did not publicly raise the case.\n\nSince the pair were detained in September 2021 a day before Huang was set to fly to Britain to study, Chinese police have interrogated dozens of individuals who attended the weekly gatherings, sometimes traveling across the country to track them down or picking people up on the street, close friends of the pair told The Washington Post in interviews. The questioning usually lasted 24 hours.\n\nThe individuals, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, say there is no basis for considering the meetings subversive. In the process of being questioned, however, it became clear that this was the conclusion police had drawn. One friend said that the interrogators used photos from events in early 2021, suggesting they had been monitoring the group for more than half a year before detaining Huang and Wang.\n\nPolice labeling these meetings an attempt to subvert the state is “a complete fabrication,” said one close friend of Huang’s who attended the gatherings. “It’s complete bulls---, coming from their own paranoia.”\n\n“We were just making friends and talking about topics ranging from how hard it is to be gay or how many nights of insomnia we had this week and how hard it is to find a job,” she said.\n\nNeither the national nor Guangzhou branches of China’s Ministry of Public Security responded to faxed requests for comment.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/68IFXHL.png)\n<center>Chinese activist Wang Jianbing in an undated photograph. (Obtained by The Washington Post)</center>\n\nThe opacity of the Chinese legal system, especially for cases that touch on national security, means the exact nature of the prosecutors’ case against Huang and Wang is still unclear, even to their lawyers. Wang’s lawyer was able to meet him for half an hour in April for the first time. Huang’s lawyer’s request to meet her client or view the prosecutor’s case against her were both denied, with authorities citing coronavirus prevention measures.\n\nBoth had previously worked on issues deemed sensitive by the Chinese state. A prominent feminist, Huang had moved from journalism to activism over the course of the #MeToo movement as she supported women to come forward with stories of sexual harassment and assault. Wang worked in labor rights nongovernmental organizations supporting workers who suffered from job-related ailments.\n\nIt’s unclear how much their activism is also considered a reason for the subversion charge. In 2019, Huang was detained for three months after she wrote articles about protests in Hong Kong against Beijing’s imposition of a stifling national security law. But friends say the police primarily appeared to be interested in the nature of the weekly meetings, as well as any international events they attended or foreign funding they might have received.\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the Chinese security state has intensified efforts to prevent dissent before it can take root. Cracks in surveillance that allowed previous generations of activists to gain traction are increasingly being filled in by new campaigns urging police vigilance against any sign of emerging threats to national security and social stability.\n\nIn past administrations, movements were often able to gain a degree of public traction before arrests. When the Chinese military put a bloody end to the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement 33 years ago Saturday, its legacy lived on in figures like Liu Xiaobo, who helped to write and promoted a manifesto known as Charter 08, which in 2008 urged an end to one-party rule.\n\nAfter the document gained thousands of signatures, Liu was imprisoned for “inciting subversion” — the same crime of which Huang and Wang are accused — shortly before he won the Nobel Peace Prize. His death from liver cancer in 2017, while under the watchful eye of Chinese security agents, drew an outpouring of grief from liberal Chinese.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZwURY9r.png)\n<center>A 2010 exhibition at the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo highlighting Liu Xiaobo.

Many, including Wang, were struggling with depression and anxiety at a time when civil society was under attack.\n\nOver tea, wine and fruit provided by Wang, they would discuss their personal struggles alongside the issues of the day. “It was not about how to respond. It was about how do we understand what’s happening. Because we didn’t think we had any space to perform any kind of activism,” one friend said.\n\nAnother friend lamented the authorities’ knee-jerk intolerance to communities operating beyond its control. “But not every meeting is about the CCP.

Huang’s lawyer’s request to meet her client or view the prosecutor’s case against her were both denied, with authorities citing coronavirus prevention measures.</p>\n<p>Both had previously worked on issues deemed sensitive by the Chinese state. A prominent feminist, Huang had moved from journalism to activism over the course of the #MeToo movement as she supported women to come forward with stories of sexual harassment and assault. Wang worked in labor rights nongovernmental organizations supporting workers who suffered from job-related ailments.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear how much their activism is also considered a reason for the subversion charge. In 2019, Huang was detained for three months after she wrote articles about protests in Hong Kong against Beijing’s imposition of a stifling national security law.

1. 喝茶前周边人被跟踪、查访及骚扰情况\n\n大多数人在被喝茶前都有身边的人被查访或骚扰，完全没有身边人被查访的比例仅占17%。完全没有身边人被骚扰的比例也仅有23%。在查访和骚扰的对象中，家人都是排在第一位。一方面，警察透过事先查访了解你的个人情况，以便约谈过程中套取更多信息。另一方面，警察常常也会透过周边人进行施压，试图透过身边人的压力来让约谈对象感到恐惧。在条件允许的情况下，建议大家在面对喝茶风险时，可以尽早与家人、同事、上司、同学等进行沟通，让他们也有心理预期，避免向警察透露过多你的私人信息。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3DzMLAe.png)\n\n## 2. 如何前往喝茶地点\n\n从前往喝茶地点开始，整个过程就已经包含了压力。只有36%的填答者是被告知时间地点后前往喝茶地点，他们有可能事先做了心理建设或准备。但其他填答者则是被上门带走、上门约谈，甚至被中途拦截。警方这些粗暴的做法让被约谈者很难对喝茶提前做准备，一开始就陷被约谈者于恐惧中。建议各位在遭遇这些突发的喝茶、约谈时，尽可能找一些个人理由尝试拒绝（例如生病要去看病、正有急事要处理），虽然当下拒绝约谈大概率无法成功，但可以为自己做好喝茶的准备争取时间。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rb78DKT.png)\n\n## 3. 如何被通知喝茶\n\n填答者中约有31%没有受到喝茶的事先通知，被直接带走或上门约谈。而其他被通知者中也有相当比例是被偷过家人或同事间接通知。直接被通知者的比例仅有42%。透过他人被通知可能造成被约谈者额外的压力，例如在与警察喝茶前先与家人发生冲突，或被工作单位警告。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8TN1ifX.png)\n\n## 4. 喝茶服务人数与服务时间\n\n下面这张图是所有填答者遭遇喝茶时的警察人数与约谈时间的分布。可以看到，大部分填答者遇到的警察数量都远远超过自己，而约谈时间大多在8小时以内，但也不乏超过10小时的情况。长时间面对大量警察都会让人感到紧张、疲惫，这是警察的目的。建议各位，也许在条件允许的情况下（例如事先知道喝茶时间地点），可以请熟识的朋友和家人在同时间待在喝茶地点附近。一方面是在心理上有被支持的感觉，另一方面，万一发生突发情况，也有求救的可能。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sBAnotI.png)\n\n## 5. 喝茶过程中的遭遇\n\n喝茶过程中，警察出现大量违法行为：（1）按照要求，警察行使职权（约谈被他们认为是自己的职权范围）必须出示警察证，但仅仅有38%的填答者见过对方警察证。（2）56%的警察要求被约谈者交出手机查询私人内容。（3）15%的警察对于被约谈者有不当肢体接触。在面对喝茶时，建议大家要求对方出示警察证，虽然这无法改变自己被约谈的处境，但也可以让对方有所忌惮，意识到被约谈者不会乖乖顺服。同时，当警察提出要查看手机时，大家是完全可以拒绝的。约谈并不是一个合法的行为，警察也没有权力搜查普通公民的私人讯息。如果手机中的讯息可能让自己陷入不利，交出手机的做法相比拒绝会带来更多危险。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AB6tdqj.png)\n\n## 6. 生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触\n\n延续\"喝茶过程中的遭遇\"的讨论，有15%的填答者遭到警察的不当肢体接触。而我们发现其中大部分人都是生理女性。这意味着喝茶过程中很可能存在性骚扰。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WQnUDip.png)\n\n## 7. 总共经历过的喝茶次数\n\n大约一半的填答者被喝茶过后，会遭遇更多次的喝茶。甚至有6位填答者总共被喝茶次数超过10次。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LmTtmLV.png)\n\n## 8. 对喝茶的意见与喝茶后遭受的影响\n\n绝大多数填答者都对喝茶表达不满，认为喝茶是非法行为、喝茶制造了恐怖寒蝉效应。相应，96%的填答者同意喝茶对自己的个人生活造成了严重困扰。但是，喝茶并不一定让填答者更不敢发表意见，有38%的填答者不同意喝茶经验让自己更谨言慎行。喝茶是警察试图让我们闭嘴、静默的手段，被喝茶之后继续说话、继续发声也是许多朋友对抗权力的方法。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UCxtIhl.png)\n\n## 9. 填答者来自地区分布\n\n填答者分布在中国各地，其中华南和华东地区的填答者较多。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oFGyxaP.png)\n\n## 10. 填答者年龄段的分布\n\n大部分填答者都是22-30岁的青年。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N9yejBe.png)\n\n## 11. “喝茶”过程中的不舒服、担忧与想法\n\n除了这些有明确选项的问题外，我们还询问了填答者一些关于喝茶过程的感受性问题，它们包括：   \n- 过程中令你不舒服的事情（服务人员对你的言语侮辱、威胁等）有哪些？\n- 喝茶过程中或喝茶之后最令你担忧的事情是什么？\n- 如果可能，请分享一下喝茶过程中你的心理状态或当时的想法？\n\n### 令被约谈者不舒服的事情\n\n许多填答者提到自己感到不舒服的事情是警察的语言恐吓威胁和暴力行为。语言恐吓包括：威胁会对家人不利、恐吓要求离开现在的工作、威胁会跟踪、威胁拘留。也有一些警察在喝茶过程中发生身体暴力行为，例如抓挠导致被约谈者淤青、大声吼叫、拍打桌面，以此吓唬被约谈者。还有一些软性的暴力行为也被提到，主要是长时间约谈，阻止被约谈者休息、不让睡觉。\n\n此外，有一位填答者提到：\n\n> 警察“对我的性取向和性别表达进行羞辱，警察说“你是同性恋是因为你没和女的做过”（尽管填答者不是男同）。\n\n### 令被约谈者担忧的事情\n\n填答者最担忧的主要是家人被影响，这可能与警察经常用家人来威胁有关，这包括担心家人恐慌、家人失去养老金、工作被影响等。其次，关于自身自由权利的担忧也常被提及，ta们主要是担心入出境的权利被剥夺以及被严密监控追踪失去隐私。\n\n还有个别填答者提到，自己最担心的是社会关系被破坏。一位填答者说自己在喝茶后被“家人认为有错，是不干净不清白的”。另一位填答者则提到喝茶造成自己与所在社群的撕裂：\n\n> （喝茶）对社群产生的间接影响，倒不是简单的造成不信任，而是喝茶一段时间后自己非常孤立，状态很需要和社群诉说，但因为喝过茶往往会和社群联系变薄弱，这一矛盾让人非常难受，久而久之也容易叠加在别的事情上最终造成社群撕裂。\n\n### 喝茶过程中的心理状态\n\n许多不同的词语在被提到，它们是：害怕、紧张、恨、愤怒、焦虑、厌恶、委屈。虽然它们大多都是负面词汇，但也有不少填答者在回答时展现出自己的反抗：\n\n> 刚开始谈话时，试图解释自己行为的合理性、正当性，试图用法律条文保护自己。但随后发现一切都是徒劳的，就只是愤怒。\n\n> 保持着谨慎和冷静，能很清楚地意识到他们的问话或者言辞是为了套取信息，制造心理恐吓，甚至是制造欺骗的囚徒困境。反正自己没有做错任何事情。\n\n> 明白这是人生的转折，所有的轨迹都变了，对未来不确定的恐惧第一反应是逃避，但也有一丝打破枷锁的快感。\n\n> 我心裡一直在重複一句話：社科人，畢生所學，只為此刻。我從不後悔為鐵鍊女發聲，我甚至沒有想到要不要去聯繫我的家人朋友。我的腦子裡只有一個想法，如果我因此消失了，那就是這個世界配不上我。\n\n> 见不得人的不是我，正是茶艺师（警察）自己\n\n> 我記得我一直在心裡默念腰樂隊的那首硬漢的歌詞：如果故事的方向和你要的都不一樣，我多想你能有勇氣開場。\n\n或许，面对国家权力的直接袭来，恐惧或焦虑的情绪都难以避免，但这并非事情的全部，更重要的是如何诠释、理解自己所遭遇的一切，如何让自己重新维持住力量，而不是被击垮。希望这份问卷中大家的回应也能够给阅读这篇文章的你一些力量。\n\n## 12. 你想对“没喝过茶”的人说些什么？\n\n在问卷的最后，我们也请填答者留下一些话，对于“没喝过茶”但有可能被约谈的人提供一些建议和支持：\n\n> 刚开始离奇的愤怒和复仇的决心，随着时间而无可奈何的淡化，变成一种沉郁而积压在心结，对一个人的影响长久、全面而持续，好像被杀过一次，与过去的你从此告别。但也因此觉醒，但总比到40.50岁时再反思之前愚昧无知的自己要心痛悔恨的少一些。（by Pearl jam）\n\n> 不要因為虛妄的權力帶來的威脅去懷疑你的本心，不要因為他人的邪惡而去質疑心中的良知。分享一個有趣的插曲吧：當時有來了三個茶店人員，直接未經我同意就衝進了我的臥室，其中一個人很高，目測有190，然而他在看見我好奇地湊過來觀看的的小貓以後，突然被嚇得面色鐵青，後退幾步——他怕貓，虛妄的權力竟然也會在小貓咪面前破防呢。（by 曲奇牛奶）\n\n> 請保持勇敢，哪怕需要簽寫保證書，也不要因此而感到灰心，我們沒有做錯的事。（by 戳戳）\n\n> 喝茶不可怕，让我们害怕才是他们的目的，保持勇敢，继续前行。（by Dao）\n\n> 可以分享的是有時大家也不用太擔心，喝茶不一定有連帶的效應，比如說連續喝茶。這個過程多少可能給你帶來創傷，但在指定監居、秘密審判等種種不正常都越來越常態化的今天，有一兩次喝茶的經驗不一定是壞事。起碼你真的見了那些你提防了、咒罵了很久的人（熊貓、國安、國保、網安..），你了解了他們問什麼、關心什麼、會做什麼，你也就對他們不會這麼害怕。（by 木頭）\n\n> 坦白从严，抗拒从宽，做好研究，坚决搞事\n\n> 不要掉以轻心，对方就是想不停套话，了解近期实际活动，身边人的情况包括生活细节等，喝茶时尽可能少说，说的多大概率达到对方目的了。（by 厌茶先生）\n\n> 数字安全从我做起。在家门口安装一个带摄像头的门铃可以让人获得很多安全感。以及权力来自人民，当他们pua的时候请时刻记住那是你让渡出去的权利，他们不可以压在你头上制造恐惧。\t（by \\*TT\\*）\n\n> 说话做事需谨慎，生命只有一次，如果有什么事是我们再三考虑后仍需要坚持完成的，那么勇敢的去做吧，恐惧可能会暂时席卷过来，但没有谁会永远活在恐惧里。（by 阿氓）\n\n> 我们有足够多的理由证明喝茶是不对的，因此我们有勇气来表明立场。但我们自以为的勇气会在喝茶后的日日夜夜，被他人的不理解，被自己对自己的质疑，消磨得干干净净。进一步说，喝茶对我的伤害是巨大的，退一步说，比起雪饼等等很多，我所遭遇的其实微不足道，也就是说，我的能力其实支撑不起我的立场，这是我最难过的。也许，一个人无法改变时代，ta只能反映时代的没落。但无论如何，我也要想告诉雪饼，还有“香港废青“，还有之前的调查记者，等等等等，你们没有错，就算你们被历史抛弃了，你们也没有错。如果这世上存在真理，那一定叫做正义。（by Augenblick）\n\n> 警察不可信，不讲法律。和警察打交道要时刻提高警惕，当警察要求你签署任何形式的文书，最好都不要签。（by 四尺）\n\n> 做好准备，一方面是尽量不要提供任何信息，因为对方追问也非常厉害。另一方面做好安全网，以让喝茶成为社群团建的动力，而非分裂的锥子。（by 凤凤）\n\n> 事前做安全評估，提前想好應對策略，喝完茶之後如果心情不好，一定找朋友聊聊，有條件的話找咨詢師，照顧好自己❤️（by Ursus）\n\n---\n\n以上就是喝茶经验调查的全部内容。也拜托大家继续关注雪饼，他们已经被带走了330天，雪饼无罪，我们要求广州警方立即释放黄雪琴与王建兵！\n\n雪饼二人最新情况请看：[黄雪琴代表律师被迫更换，王建兵案件被退回二次侦查](https://freexqjb.netlify.app/2022/08/12/news0812/)\n","source":"_posts/hecha-1.md","raw":"---\nlayout:

“喝茶”过程中的不舒服、担忧与想法\n\n除了这些有明确选项的问题外，我们还询问了填答者一些关于喝茶过程的感受性问题，它们包括：   \n- 过程中令你不舒服的事情（服务人员对你的言语侮辱、威胁等）有哪些？\n- 喝茶过程中或喝茶之后最令你担忧的事情是什么？\n- 如果可能，请分享一下喝茶过程中你的心理状态或当时的想法？\n\n### 令被约谈者不舒服的事情\n\n许多填答者提到自己感到不舒服的事情是警察的语言恐吓威胁和暴力行为。语言恐吓包括：威胁会对家人不利、恐吓要求离开现在的工作、威胁会跟踪、威胁拘留。也有一些警察在喝茶过程中发生身体暴力行为，例如抓挠导致被约谈者淤青、大声吼叫、拍打桌面，以此吓唬被约谈者。还有一些软性的暴力行为也被提到，主要是长时间约谈，阻止被约谈者休息、不让睡觉。\n\n此外，有一位填答者提到：\n\n> 警察“对我的性取向和性别表达进行羞辱，警察说“你是同性恋是因为你没和女的做过”（尽管填答者不是男同）。\n\n### 令被约谈者担忧的事情\n\n填答者最担忧的主要是家人被影响，这可能与警察经常用家人来威胁有关，这包括担心家人恐慌、家人失去养老金、工作被影响等。其次，关于自身自由权利的担忧也常被提及，ta们主要是担心入出境的权利被剥夺以及被严密监控追踪失去隐私。\n\n还有个别填答者提到，自己最担心的是社会关系被破坏。一位填答者说自己在喝茶后被“家人认为有错，是不干净不清白的”。另一位填答者则提到喝茶造成自己与所在社群的撕裂：\n\n> （喝茶）对社群产生的间接影响，倒不是简单的造成不信任，而是喝茶一段时间后自己非常孤立，状态很需要和社群诉说，但因为喝过茶往往会和社群联系变薄弱，这一矛盾让人非常难受，久而久之也容易叠加在别的事情上最终造成社群撕裂。\n\n### 喝茶过程中的心理状态\n\n许多不同的词语在被提到，它们是：害怕、紧张、恨、愤怒、焦虑、厌恶、委屈。虽然它们大多都是负面词汇，但也有不少填答者在回答时展现出自己的反抗：\n\n> 刚开始谈话时，试图解释自己行为的合理性、正当性，试图用法律条文保护自己。但随后发现一切都是徒劳的，就只是愤怒。\n\n> 保持着谨慎和冷静，能很清楚地意识到他们的问话或者言辞是为了套取信息，制造心理恐吓，甚至是制造欺骗的囚徒困境。反正自己没有做错任何事情。\n\n> 明白这是人生的转折，所有的轨迹都变了，对未来不确定的恐惧第一反应是逃避，但也有一丝打破枷锁的快感。\n\n> 我心裡一直在重複一句話：社科人，畢生所學，只為此刻。我從不後悔為鐵鍊女發聲，我甚至沒有想到要不要去聯繫我的家人朋友。我的腦子裡只有一個想法，如果我因此消失了，那就是這個世界配不上我。\n\n> 见不得人的不是我，正是茶艺师（警察）自己\n\n> 我記得我一直在心裡默念腰樂隊的那首硬漢的歌詞：如果故事的方向和你要的都不一樣，我多想你能有勇氣開場。\n\n或许，面对国家权力的直接袭来，恐惧或焦虑的情绪都难以避免，但这并非事情的全部，更重要的是如何诠释、理解自己所遭遇的一切，如何让自己重新维持住力量，而不是被击垮。希望这份问卷中大家的回应也能够给阅读这篇文章的你一些力量。\n\n## 12. 你想对“没喝过茶”的人说些什么？\n\n在问卷的最后，我们也请填答者留下一些话，对于“没喝过茶”但有可能被约谈的人提供一些建议和支持：\n\n> 刚开始离奇的愤怒和复仇的决心，随着时间而无可奈何的淡化，变成一种沉郁而积压在心结，对一个人的影响长久、全面而持续，好像被杀过一次，与过去的你从此告别。但也因此觉醒，但总比到40.50岁时再反思之前愚昧无知的自己要心痛悔恨的少一些。（by Pearl jam）\n\n> 不要因為虛妄的權力帶來的威脅去懷疑你的本心，不要因為他人的邪惡而去質疑心中的良知。分享一個有趣的插曲吧：當時有來了三個茶店人員，直接未經我同意就衝進了我的臥室，其中一個人很高，目測有190，然而他在看見我好奇地湊過來觀看的的小貓以後，突然被嚇得面色鐵青，後退幾步——他怕貓，虛妄的權力竟然也會在小貓咪面前破防呢。（by 曲奇牛奶）\n\n> 請保持勇敢，哪怕需要簽寫保證書，也不要因此而感到灰心，我們沒有做錯的事。（by 戳戳）\n\n> 喝茶不可怕，让我们害怕才是他们的目的，保持勇敢，继续前行。（by Dao）\n\n> 可以分享的是有時大家也不用太擔心，喝茶不一定有連帶的效應，比如說連續喝茶。這個過程多少可能給你帶來創傷，但在指定監居、秘密審判等種種不正常都越來越常態化的今天，有一兩次喝茶的經驗不一定是壞事。起碼你真的見了那些你提防了、咒罵了很久的人（熊貓、國安、國保、網安..），你了解了他們問什麼、關心什麼、會做什麼，你也就對他們不會這麼害怕。（by 木頭）\n\n> 坦白从严，抗拒从宽，做好研究，坚决搞事\n\n> 不要掉以轻心，对方就是想不停套话，了解近期实际活动，身边人的情况包括生活细节等，喝茶时尽可能少说，说的多大概率达到对方目的了。（by 厌茶先生）\n\n> 数字安全从我做起。在家门口安装一个带摄像头的门铃可以让人获得很多安全感。以及权力来自人民，当他们pua的时候请时刻记住那是你让渡出去的权利，他们不可以压在你头上制造恐惧。\t（by \\*TT\\*）\n\n> 说话做事需谨慎，生命只有一次，如果有什么事是我们再三考虑后仍需要坚持完成的，那么勇敢的去做吧，恐惧可能会暂时席卷过来，但没有谁会永远活在恐惧里。（by 阿氓）\n\n> 我们有足够多的理由证明喝茶是不对的，因此我们有勇气来表明立场。但我们自以为的勇气会在喝茶后的日日夜夜，被他人的不理解，被自己对自己的质疑，消磨得干干净净。进一步说，喝茶对我的伤害是巨大的，退一步说，比起雪饼等等很多，我所遭遇的其实微不足道，也就是说，我的能力其实支撑不起我的立场，这是我最难过的。也许，一个人无法改变时代，ta只能反映时代的没落。但无论如何，我也要想告诉雪饼，还有“香港废青“，还有之前的调查记者，等等等等，你们没有错，就算你们被历史抛弃了，你们也没有错。如果这世上存在真理，那一定叫做正义。（by Augenblick）\n\n> 警察不可信，不讲法律。和警察打交道要时刻提高警惕，当警察要求你签署任何形式的文书，最好都不要签。（by 四尺）\n\n> 做好准备，一方面是尽量不要提供任何信息，因为对方追问也非常厉害。另一方面做好安全网，以让喝茶成为社群团建的动力，而非分裂的锥子。（by 凤凤）\n\n> 事前做安全評估，提前想好應對策略，喝完茶之後如果心情不好，一定找朋友聊聊，有條件的話找咨詢師，照顧好自己❤️（by Ursus）\n\n---\n\n以上就是喝茶经验调查的全部内容。也拜托大家继续关注雪饼，他们已经被带走了330天，雪饼无罪，我们要求广州警方立即释放黄雪琴与王建兵！\n\n雪饼二人最新情况请看：[黄雪琴代表律师被迫更换，王建兵案件被退回二次侦查](https://freexqjb.netlify.app/2022/08/12/news0812/)\n","slug":"hecha-1","published":1,"updated":"2022-08-16T02:11:20.986Z","_id":"cl6qmaiy00000jlk2813d0ww7","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>今天是雪饼被带走的330天，110天前，我们发起了<a

src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SKsaazf.png\"></p>\n<p>最终，我们总共搜集到48份有效的回复，将其重点整理为以下10张图表。同时，问卷中也有一些开放性的涉及个人经验的问题，我们将其中重点整理在文章最后。</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-喝茶前周边人被跟踪、查访及骚扰情况\"><a href=\"#1-喝茶前周边人被跟踪、查访及骚扰情况\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1. 喝茶前周边人被跟踪、查访及骚扰情况\"></a>1. 喝茶前周边人被跟踪、查访及骚扰情况</h2><p>大多数人在被喝茶前都有身边的人被查访或骚扰，完全没有身边人被查访的比例仅占17%。完全没有身边人被骚扰的比例也仅有23%。在查访和骚扰的对象中，家人都是排在第一位。一方面，警察透过事先查访了解你的个人情况，以便约谈过程中套取更多信息。另一方面，警察常常也会透过周边人进行施压，试图透过身边人的压力来让约谈对象感到恐惧。在条件允许的情况下，建议大家在面对喝茶风险时，可以尽早与家人、同事、上司、同学等进行沟通，让他们也有心理预期，避免向警察透露过多你的私人信息。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3DzMLAe.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"2-如何前往喝茶地点\"><a href=\"#2-如何前往喝茶地点\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2. 如何前往喝茶地点\"></a>2. 如何前往喝茶地点</h2><p>从前往喝茶地点开始，整个过程就已经包含了压力。只有36%的填答者是被告知时间地点后前往喝茶地点，他们有可能事先做了心理建设或准备。但其他填答者则是被上门带走、上门约谈，甚至被中途拦截。警方这些粗暴的做法让被约谈者很难对喝茶提前做准备，一开始就陷被约谈者于恐惧中。建议各位在遭遇这些突发的喝茶、约谈时，尽可能找一些个人理由尝试拒绝（例如生病要去看病、正有急事要处理），虽然当下拒绝约谈大概率无法成功，但可以为自己做好喝茶的准备争取时间。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Rb78DKT.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-如何被通知喝茶\"><a href=\"#3-如何被通知喝茶\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3. 如何被通知喝茶\"></a>3. 如何被通知喝茶</h2><p>填答者中约有31%没有受到喝茶的事先通知，被直接带走或上门约谈。而其他被通知者中也有相当比例是被偷过家人或同事间接通知。直接被通知者的比例仅有42%。透过他人被通知可能造成被约谈者额外的压力，例如在与警察喝茶前先与家人发生冲突，或被工作单位警告。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8TN1ifX.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"4-喝茶服务人数与服务时间\"><a href=\"#4-喝茶服务人数与服务时间\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"4. 喝茶服务人数与服务时间\"></a>4. 喝茶服务人数与服务时间</h2><p>下面这张图是所有填答者遭遇喝茶时的警察人数与约谈时间的分布。可以看到，大部分填答者遇到的警察数量都远远超过自己，而约谈时间大多在8小时以内，但也不乏超过10小时的情况。长时间面对大量警察都会让人感到紧张、疲惫，这是警察的目的。建议各位，也许在条件允许的情况下（例如事先知道喝茶时间地点），可以请熟识的朋友和家人在同时间待在喝茶地点附近。一方面是在心理上有被支持的感觉，另一方面，万一发生突发情况，也有求救的可能。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sBAnotI.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"5-喝茶过程中的遭遇\"><a href=\"#5-喝茶过程中的遭遇\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"5. 喝茶过程中的遭遇\"></a>5. 喝茶过程中的遭遇</h2><p>喝茶过程中，警察出现大量违法行为：（1）按照要求，警察行使职权（约谈被他们认为是自己的职权范围）必须出示警察证，但仅仅有38%的填答者见过对方警察证。（2）56%的警察要求被约谈者交出手机查询私人内容。（3）15%的警察对于被约谈者有不当肢体接触。在面对喝茶时，建议大家要求对方出示警察证，虽然这无法改变自己被约谈的处境，但也可以让对方有所忌惮，意识到被约谈者不会乖乖顺服。同时，当警察提出要查看手机时，大家是完全可以拒绝的。约谈并不是一个合法的行为，警察也没有权力搜查普通公民的私人讯息。如果手机中的讯息可能让自己陷入不利，交出手机的做法相比拒绝会带来更多危险。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AB6tdqj.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"6-生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触\"><a href=\"#6-生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"6. 生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触\"></a>6. 生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触</h2><p>延续”喝茶过程中的遭遇”的讨论，有15%的填答者遭到警察的不当肢体接触。而我们发现其中大部分人都是生理女性。这意味着喝茶过程中很可能存在性骚扰。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WQnUDip.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"7-总共经历过的喝茶次数\"><a href=\"#7-总共经历过的喝茶次数\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"7. 总共经历过的喝茶次数\"></a>7. 总共经历过的喝茶次数</h2><p>大约一半的填答者被喝茶过后，会遭遇更多次的喝茶。甚至有6位填答者总共被喝茶次数超过10次。</p>\n<p><img

如何前往喝茶地点</h2><p>从前往喝茶地点开始，整个过程就已经包含了压力。只有36%的填答者是被告知时间地点后前往喝茶地点，他们有可能事先做了心理建设或准备。但其他填答者则是被上门带走、上门约谈，甚至被中途拦截。警方这些粗暴的做法让被约谈者很难对喝茶提前做准备，一开始就陷被约谈者于恐惧中。建议各位在遭遇这些突发的喝茶、约谈时，尽可能找一些个人理由尝试拒绝（例如生病要去看病、正有急事要处理），虽然当下拒绝约谈大概率无法成功，但可以为自己做好喝茶的准备争取时间。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Rb78DKT.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-如何被通知喝茶\"><a href=\"#3-如何被通知喝茶\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3. 如何被通知喝茶\"></a>3. 如何被通知喝茶</h2><p>填答者中约有31%没有受到喝茶的事先通知，被直接带走或上门约谈。而其他被通知者中也有相当比例是被偷过家人或同事间接通知。直接被通知者的比例仅有42%。透过他人被通知可能造成被约谈者额外的压力，例如在与警察喝茶前先与家人发生冲突，或被工作单位警告。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8TN1ifX.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"4-喝茶服务人数与服务时间\"><a href=\"#4-喝茶服务人数与服务时间\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"4. 喝茶服务人数与服务时间\"></a>4. 喝茶服务人数与服务时间</h2><p>下面这张图是所有填答者遭遇喝茶时的警察人数与约谈时间的分布。可以看到，大部分填答者遇到的警察数量都远远超过自己，而约谈时间大多在8小时以内，但也不乏超过10小时的情况。长时间面对大量警察都会让人感到紧张、疲惫，这是警察的目的。建议各位，也许在条件允许的情况下（例如事先知道喝茶时间地点），可以请熟识的朋友和家人在同时间待在喝茶地点附近。一方面是在心理上有被支持的感觉，另一方面，万一发生突发情况，也有求救的可能。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sBAnotI.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"5-喝茶过程中的遭遇\"><a href=\"#5-喝茶过程中的遭遇\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"5. 喝茶过程中的遭遇\"></a>5. 喝茶过程中的遭遇</h2><p>喝茶过程中，警察出现大量违法行为：（1）按照要求，警察行使职权（约谈被他们认为是自己的职权范围）必须出示警察证，但仅仅有38%的填答者见过对方警察证。（2）56%的警察要求被约谈者交出手机查询私人内容。（3）15%的警察对于被约谈者有不当肢体接触。在面对喝茶时，建议大家要求对方出示警察证，虽然这无法改变自己被约谈的处境，但也可以让对方有所忌惮，意识到被约谈者不会乖乖顺服。同时，当警察提出要查看手机时，大家是完全可以拒绝的。约谈并不是一个合法的行为，警察也没有权力搜查普通公民的私人讯息。如果手机中的讯息可能让自己陷入不利，交出手机的做法相比拒绝会带来更多危险。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AB6tdqj.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"6-生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触\"><a href=\"#6-生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"6. 生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触\"></a>6. 生理女性有较高比例遭到警察不当肢体接触</h2><p>延续”喝茶过程中的遭遇”的讨论，有15%的填答者遭到警察的不当肢体接触。而我们发现其中大部分人都是生理女性。这意味着喝茶过程中很可能存在性骚扰。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WQnUDip.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"7-总共经历过的喝茶次数\"><a href=\"#7-总共经历过的喝茶次数\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"7. 总共经历过的喝茶次数\"></a>7. 总共经历过的喝茶次数</h2><p>大约一半的填答者被喝茶过后，会遭遇更多次的喝茶。甚至有6位填答者总共被喝茶次数超过10次。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LmTtmLV.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"8-对喝茶的意见与喝茶后遭受的影响\"><a href=\"#8-对喝茶的意见与喝茶后遭受的影响\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"8. 对喝茶的意见与喝茶后遭受的影响\"></a>8. 对喝茶的意见与喝茶后遭受的影响</h2><p>绝大多数填答者都对喝茶表达不满，认为喝茶是非法行为、喝茶制造了恐怖寒蝉效应。相应，96%的填答者同意喝茶对自己的个人生活造成了严重困扰。但是，喝茶并不一定让填答者更不敢发表意见，有38%的填答者不同意喝茶经验让自己更谨言慎行。喝茶是警察试图让我们闭嘴、静默的手段，被喝茶之后继续说话、继续发声也是许多朋友对抗权力的方法。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UCxtIhl.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"9-填答者来自地区分布\"><a href=\"#9-填答者来自地区分布\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"9. 填答者来自地区分布\"></a>9. 填答者来自地区分布</h2><p>填答者分布在中国各地，其中华南和华东地区的填答者较多。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oFGyxaP.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"10-填答者年龄段的分布\"><a href=\"#10-填答者年龄段的分布\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"10. 填答者年龄段的分布\"></a>10. 填答者年龄段的分布</h2><p>大部分填答者都是22-30岁的青年。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/N9yejBe.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"11-“喝茶”过程中的不舒服、担忧与想法\"><a href=\"#11-“喝茶”过程中的不舒服、担忧与想法\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"11. “喝茶”过程中的不舒服、担忧与想法\"></a>11. “喝茶”过程中的不舒服、担忧与想法</h2><p>除了这些有明确选项的问题外，我们还询问了填答者一些关于喝茶过程的感受性问题，它们包括：   </p>\n<ul>\n<li>过程中令你不舒服的事情（服务人员对你的言语侮辱、威胁等）有哪些？</li>\n<li>喝茶过程中或喝茶之后最令你担忧的事情是什么？</li>\n<li>如果可能，请分享一下喝茶过程中你的心理状态或当时的想法？</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"令被约谈者不舒服的事情\"><a href=\"#令被约谈者不舒服的事情\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"令被约谈者不舒服的事情\"></a>令被约谈者不舒服的事情</h3><p>许多填答者提到自己感到不舒服的事情是警察的语言恐吓威胁和暴力行为。语言恐吓包括：威胁会对家人不利、恐吓要求离开现在的工作、威胁会跟踪、威胁拘留。也有一些警察在喝茶过程中发生身体暴力行为，例如抓挠导致被约谈者淤青、大声吼叫、拍打桌面，以此吓唬被约谈者。还有一些软性的暴力行为也被提到，主要是长时间约谈，阻止被约谈者休息、不让睡觉。</p>\n<p>此外，有一位填答者提到：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>警察“对我的性取向和性别表达进行羞辱，警察说“你是同性恋是因为你没和女的做过”（尽管填答者不是男同）。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"令被约谈者担忧的事情\"><a href=\"#令被约谈者担忧的事情\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"令被约谈者担忧的事情\"></a>令被约谈者担忧的事情</h3><p>填答者最担忧的主要是家人被影响，这可能与警察经常用家人来威胁有关，这包括担心家人恐慌、家人失去养老金、工作被影响等。其次，关于自身自由权利的担忧也常被提及，ta们主要是担心入出境的权利被剥夺以及被严密监控追踪失去隐私。</p>\n<p>还有个别填答者提到，自己最担心的是社会关系被破坏。一位填答者说自己在喝茶后被“家人认为有错，是不干净不清白的”。另一位填答者则提到喝茶造成自己与所在社群的撕裂：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>（喝茶）对社群产生的间接影响，倒不是简单的造成不信任，而是喝茶一段时间后自己非常孤立，状态很需要和社群诉说，但因为喝过茶往往会和社群联系变薄弱，这一矛盾让人非常难受，久而久之也容易叠加在别的事情上最终造成社群撕裂。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"喝茶过程中的心理状态\"><a href=\"#喝茶过程中的心理状态\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"喝茶过程中的心理状态\"></a>喝茶过程中的心理状态</h3><p>许多不同的词语在被提到，它们是：害怕、紧张、恨、愤怒、焦虑、厌恶、委屈。虽然它们大多都是负面词汇，但也有不少填答者在回答时展现出自己的反抗：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>刚开始谈话时，试图解释自己行为的合理性、正当性，试图用法律条文保护自己。但随后发现一切都是徒劳的，就只是愤怒。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>保持着谨慎和冷静，能很清楚地意识到他们的问话或者言辞是为了套取信息，制造心理恐吓，甚至是制造欺骗的囚徒困境。反正自己没有做错任何事情。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>明白这是人生的转折，所有的轨迹都变了，对未来不确定的恐惧第一反应是逃避，但也有一丝打破枷锁的快感。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>我心裡一直在重複一句話：社科人，畢生所學，只為此刻。我從不後悔為鐵鍊女發聲，我甚至沒有想到要不要去聯繫我的家人朋友。我的腦子裡只有一個想法，如果我因此消失了，那就是這個世界配不上我。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>见不得人的不是我，正是茶艺师（警察）自己</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>我記得我一直在心裡默念腰樂隊的那首硬漢的歌詞：如果故事的方向和你要的都不一樣，我多想你能有勇氣開場。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>或许，面对国家权力的直接袭来，恐惧或焦虑的情绪都难以避免，但这并非事情的全部，更重要的是如何诠释、理解自己所遭遇的一切，如何让自己重新维持住力量，而不是被击垮。希望这份问卷中大家的回应也能够给阅读这篇文章的你一些力量。</p>\n<h2 id=\"12-你想对“没喝过茶”的人说些什么？\"><a href=\"#12-你想对“没喝过茶”的人说些什么？\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"12. 你想对“没喝过茶”的人说些什么？\"></a>12. 你想对“没喝过茶”的人说些什么？</h2><p>在问卷的最后，我们也请填答者留下一些话，对于“没喝过茶”但有可能被约谈的人提供一些建议和支持：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>刚开始离奇的愤怒和复仇的决心，随着时间而无可奈何的淡化，变成一种沉郁而积压在心结，对一个人的影响长久、全面而持续，好像被杀过一次，与过去的你从此告别。但也因此觉醒，但总比到40.50岁时再反思之前愚昧无知的自己要心痛悔恨的少一些。（by Pearl jam）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>不要因為虛妄的權力帶來的威脅去懷疑你的本心，不要因為他人的邪惡而去質疑心中的良知。分享一個有趣的插曲吧：當時有來了三個茶店人員，直接未經我同意就衝進了我的臥室，其中一個人很高，目測有190，然而他在看見我好奇地湊過來觀看的的小貓以後，突然被嚇得面色鐵青，後退幾步——他怕貓，虛妄的權力竟然也會在小貓咪面前破防呢。（by 曲奇牛奶）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>請保持勇敢，哪怕需要簽寫保證書，也不要因此而感到灰心，我們沒有做錯的事。（by 戳戳）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>喝茶不可怕，让我们害怕才是他们的目的，保持勇敢，继续前行。（by Dao）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>可以分享的是有時大家也不用太擔心，喝茶不一定有連帶的效應，比如說連續喝茶。這個過程多少可能給你帶來創傷，但在指定監居、秘密審判等種種不正常都越來越常態化的今天，有一兩次喝茶的經驗不一定是壞事。起碼你真的見了那些你提防了、咒罵了很久的人（熊貓、國安、國保、網安..），你了解了他們問什麼、關心什麼、會做什麼，你也就對他們不會這麼害怕。（by 木頭）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>坦白从严，抗拒从宽，做好研究，坚决搞事</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>不要掉以轻心，对方就是想不停套话，了解近期实际活动，身边人的情况包括生活细节等，喝茶时尽可能少说，说的多大概率达到对方目的了。（by 厌茶先生）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>数字安全从我做起。在家门口安装一个带摄像头的门铃可以让人获得很多安全感。以及权力来自人民，当他们pua的时候请时刻记住那是你让渡出去的权利，他们不可以压在你头上制造恐惧。    （by *TT*）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>说话做事需谨慎，生命只有一次，如果有什么事是我们再三考虑后仍需要坚持完成的，那么勇敢的去做吧，恐惧可能会暂时席卷过来，但没有谁会永远活在恐惧里。（by 阿氓）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>我们有足够多的理由证明喝茶是不对的，因此我们有勇气来表明立场。但我们自以为的勇气会在喝茶后的日日夜夜，被他人的不理解，被自己对自己的质疑，消磨得干干净净。进一步说，喝茶对我的伤害是巨大的，退一步说，比起雪饼等等很多，我所遭遇的其实微不足道，也就是说，我的能力其实支撑不起我的立场，这是我最难过的。也许，一个人无法改变时代，ta只能反映时代的没落。但无论如何，我也要想告诉雪饼，还有“香港废青“，还有之前的调查记者，等等等等，你们没有错，就算你们被历史抛弃了，你们也没有错。如果这世上存在真理，那一定叫做正义。（by Augenblick）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>警察不可信，不讲法律。和警察打交道要时刻提高警惕，当警察要求你签署任何形式的文书，最好都不要签。（by 四尺）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>做好准备，一方面是尽量不要提供任何信息，因为对方追问也非常厉害。另一方面做好安全网，以让喝茶成为社群团建的动力，而非分裂的锥子。（by 凤凤）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>事前做安全評估，提前想好應對策略，喝完茶之後如果心情不好，一定找朋友聊聊，有條件的話找咨詢師，照顧好自己❤️（by Ursus）</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>以上就是喝茶经验调查的全部内容。也拜托大家继续关注雪饼，他们已经被带走了330天，雪饼无罪，我们要求广州警方立即释放黄雪琴与王建兵！</p>\n<p>雪饼二人最新情况请看：<a

rights defenders **Huang Xueqin** and **Wang Jianbing** (“***XueBing***” for short) were forcibly arrested by the Guangzhou police on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power”. Using COVID as an excuse, they were held for at least five months in solitary confinement, and subjected to secret interrogation, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL., a form of detention that seriously violates international human rights principles.\n\nThe weekly gatherings with friends that XueBing organized and participated in were characterized by the police as a threat to national security. Over the past year, the police have continually fabricated evidence based on these false accusations, coerced Huang into replacing her lawyer, interrogated and harassed dozens of civil activists. This further clamped down on China’s already weakened civil society.\n\nAs of today, Huang Xueqin, the #MeToo activist and independent journalist, and Wang Jianbing, the labor rights advocate, have been arbitrarily detained for over a year. They were formally arrested on October 27, 2021, and transferred to the Procuratorate Office on March 27, 2022. After being returned for supplementary investigation twice, the case was finally submitted to the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court for its first instance at mid-August 2022. The two are now being detained in the Guangzhou No. 3 Detention Center *(Previously, XueBing were detailed at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, but since the beginning of July 2022, the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center was merged into the No. 3 Detention Center)* \n\n## **1. The One-Year Anniversary Review of the \"XueBing\" Case**\n\n### **1.1 XueBing were subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention for more than five months after their disappearance.**\n\nOn September 19, 2021, the Guangzhou police forcibly arrested XueBing on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\" on the grounds that they had been organizing social gatherings at their home for a long time. Since then, the Guangzhou police never delivered the “Notice of Detention\" as required by law to the families of the two. It was not until April 1, 2022, when Wang met with his lawyer for the first time, that we learned that Wang had been illegally detained incommunicado in a location hitherto unknown for secret interrogation for at least five months, on the grounds of \"COVID prevention.” He was finally transferred to a collective detention center in the sixth month since his arrest. When detained incommunicado, Wang was subjected to dozens of grueling questioning, as well as both physical and psychological torturing, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL. By using Covid as an excuse, the Guangzhou police circumvented the use of RSDL, a measure that has been criticized heavily by the international community and the United Nations, on official written documents at least. Huang Xueqin was also held in a similar situation, but we were unable to obtain more specific details because she was deprived of her freedom of communication and access to a lawyer(s) of her choice over the past year.\n\nDuring his incommunicado detention, Wang Jianbing's physical and mental condition were exacerbated: he not only suffered from irregular diet and gastrointestinal disorders, but also mental fatigue and depression. Huang Xueqin lost 5kg (~11lb) in the first six months of her detention, given that she already weighed less than 50kg before her arrest.\n\n### **1.2 Huang Xueqin's lawyer was forced to withdraw and replaced by a government-appointed lawyer.**\n\nHuang's current situation in the detention center remains unknown. In late March 2022, Huang's family appointed Wan MiaoYan (万淼焱), one of Huang’s long-time friends, to represent her, and the engagement letter was sent to the detention center and signed by Huang. However, later in mid-April, the police suddenly presented a “termination letter” signed by Huang, claiming that Huang had terminated her engagement with Wan. In late April, Wan tried to go to the detention center to confirm the situation with Huang, but her request to meet with Huang was also denied by the detention center on the grounds of \"COVID prevention.” Huang has been represented by a government-appointed lawyer(s) since then.\n\nUntil now, Huang's family and friends still have no way of knowing her current condition because she has been deprived of freedom of communication. This is a very worrying situation. When she was last arrested in 2019 for documenting the \"Anti-Extradition Law Movement” protest in Hong Kong, she was represented by Wan Miaoyan too. However, this time, despite Huang having signed letter to engage Wan, Wan was quickly replaced by a government-appointed lawyer, which raises suspicions that Huang was coerced into making this decision.\n\n### **1.3 Civil society activists faced harassment, illegal interrogation and/or eviction.**\n\nSince XueBing’s arrest, the Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, have continued to issue local or cross-regional subpoenas or conduct interrogations. Over 70 of XueBing’s friends and gathering participants have been summoned by the police for interrogation, and, according to the preliminary statistics, among which more than 10 activists were evicted from or pressured to leave Guangzhou by the police through various means (such as pressure on landlords, intimidation of family members, continuous harassment of the activists, etc.). Without following legal procedure, the Guangzhou police interrogated the activists for up to 24 hours, some even multiple times, and forcibly searched and downloaded contents from their electronic devices. \n\nFurthermore, the police also forced and threatened some of XueBing’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police. They were forcibly asked to identify that XueBing had participated in the so-called training activities related to “subvert state power” and to fabricate the gathering at Jianbing’s apartment as a political event criticizing the government. The multiple written records the police have collected and produced over the last year consisted primarily of falsified testimonies signed by civil activists/friends of XueBing under duress, or outright fabrications by the police.\n\n## **2. The Latest Updates: the Case has been transferred to the court**\n\nAccording to various sources, we have learned that the case of Wang Jianbing has been transferred to the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on August 12, 2022, while the case of Huang Xueqin remains enshrouded. It is speculated that the two cases should now reach the court together without separate trials. According to Article 202 of the PRC *Criminal Procedural Law* , the court should conclude a case and come to a verdict no later than 180 days after the indictment is formally accepted. However, during the 180-day period of the first instance, the court may return the case to the Procuratorate Office again to conduct an additional investigation for a period up of to a month, after which the case will be resubmitted to the court with a fresh start of another 180 day.\n\nAlthough XueBing’s case has been transferred to court and is in its first instance, we are unable to estimate when the case would be tried. The PRC Criminal Procedure Law provides the judiciary with ample discretion power to prolong the hearing timing. However, we still can foresee that the trial of XueBing would be totally an unjust, government-directed, formalist and closed-door secret trial. At this stage, we believe that the two will extremely likely face immense political pressure, especially Huang Xueqin, who has even been deprived of the right to legal counsel, all this to make sure that the two would plead guilty to the absurd and unfounded charges on trial.\n\n## **3 Appeals from Friends of XueBing**\n\nIt has been six months since we lost contact with our beloved friends Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. During their darkest days in solitary confinement without access to lawyers, friends and family, we cannot imagine the kind of torture and humiliation they are going through. The tactics adopted by the Chinese authorities to suppress civil society and activists are clear by now—through continuously fabricating evidence, torturing the activist under solitary confinement (or RSDL), and cutting all means of communication and counsel with their lawyer, the authorities drag the case on and on until the activists *confess* to their supposed crime. We are enraged that XueBing have been going through such inhumane treatment.\n\nThe year-long incommunicado detention must have a huge detrimental impact on XueBing’s physical and mental health, which we, as their friends and family, have been deeply concerned about. However, we believe XueBing must still hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a crime, participating in #MeToo is not a crime, supporting workers is not a crime, and fighting for social justice should never be a crime!\n\nAs Friends of Huang and Wang:\n\n\\*We strongly condemn the arbitrary detention and criminal charges of Huang and Wang by the Guangzhou authorities. We demand that the authorities immediately disclose their physical and mental health conditions. The authorities must guarantee Huang’s access to legal counsel for her own choice without intimidation, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to communication and to a fair trial,  and their lawyers’ right to provide counsel and access to case files without intervention.\n\n\\*We strongly urge the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court to conduct an open trial rather than closed-door, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to legal representation and their lawyers’ basic right of defense, and initiate a strict scrutinization of the numerous fabricated ‘facts’ and ‘evidence’ associated with the case.\n\n\\*We are sincerely grateful to international NGOs, human rights organizations, media outlets and the global civil society community for their solidarity support to Huang and Wang. We believe, Huang and Wang would also very appreciate everyone’s continued concern on the situations of human rights abuse in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.\n\n\\*We deeply wish all of Huang and Wang’s friends and comrades in civil society who have been affected by this case to stay STRONG. Political repression will make us severely fearful, but only the unity, company and mutual support of each other can keep us strong and free. This is also what Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing have been working on in their struggle.\n\n## **4.

In the UK, [55 feminist scholars](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/11/55_scholars_support/) and [83 members of the UK University and College Union (UCU)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWshZFjBN5Qyn9TCEaRDS2HfTZV2o6JPWAA-vFjb1VVCemtg/viewform) respectively initiated and participated in a joint signature, demanding that the Chinese government immediately release Huang and Wang; [112 Chevening scholars](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/12/07/statement1208/) issued a joint statement expressing serious concern over the arbitrary detention and inability to visit the activists, and urged the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office and its Chevening Committee to speak out on the matter.\n\nd. Nearly 100 friends from all over the world sent [postcards](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/12/26/postcard_event/) to Huang and Wang, expressing their concern and blessings for them and protesting against the police illegality. In addition, supporters in London, Hong Kong, Taipei, the United Arab Emirates and other places wore [masks](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/05/xuebing_world/) of Huang and Wang to protest in various parts of the city, calling on the Chinese government to release the two.\n\ne. On the day of May 3, 2022, the World Press Freedom Day, a [social media campaign](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/05/03/pressday/) initiated by the human rights NGO ISHR, joining with half a dozen of other international NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, Front Line Defenders, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, etc, to show great concern on the situations of the imprisoned journalist Huang Xueqin, and call on the Chinese government release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing immediately and unconditionally.\n\nf. In [February 2022](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=27049), six of UN independent expert- including the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - sent a letter to the Chinese government expressing serious concern over Wang Jianbing’s enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention. [On April 1](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadFile?gId=36931), the Chinese government simply denied the allegation. [On May 11](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/A-HRC-WGAD-2022-9-CHN-AEV.pdf), the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention formally declared that Wang’s detention to be “arbitrary” and urged authorities to ensure his immediate release and access to remedy.\n\ng. In May 2022, Huang Xueqin was nominated by Index on Censorship, an NGO that has long been concerned with freedom of expression globally, as one of the three candidates for the 2022 [\"Freedom of Expression Awards\" in journalism](https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2022/05/journalism-2022/). The award honors those standing on the front lines of freedom of expression around the world, of which Huang Xueqin is seen as a key figure – her significant role in covering and initiating the Chinese MeToo movement, as well in supporting the sexual victims.\n\nh. In June 2022, Huang Xueqin was awarded [Wallis Annenberg Justice for Women Journalists Award](https://www.iwmf.org/community/xueqin-sophia-huang/) by the International Women's Media Fund (IWMF), which honors women journalists who show remarkable persistence and bravery. The award praised Huang's career reporting on injustice & corruption in China – including pioneering the #MeToo movement.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8LZmCcN.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ewdQ6O1.png)","source":"_posts/365-en.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Statement on the One-year

rights defenders **Huang Xueqin** and **Wang Jianbing** (“***XueBing***” for short) were forcibly arrested by the Guangzhou police on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power”. Using COVID as an excuse, they were held for at least five months in solitary confinement, and subjected to secret interrogation, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL., a form of detention that seriously violates international human rights principles.\n\nThe weekly gatherings with friends that XueBing organized and participated in were characterized by the police as a threat to national security. Over the past year, the police have continually fabricated evidence based on these false accusations, coerced Huang into replacing her lawyer, interrogated and harassed dozens of civil activists. This further clamped down on China’s already weakened civil society.\n\nAs of today, Huang Xueqin, the #MeToo activist and independent journalist, and Wang Jianbing, the labor rights advocate, have been arbitrarily detained for over a year. They were formally arrested on October 27, 2021, and transferred to the Procuratorate Office on March 27, 2022. After being returned for supplementary investigation twice, the case was finally submitted to the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court for its first instance at mid-August 2022. The two are now being detained in the Guangzhou No. 3 Detention Center *(Previously, XueBing were detailed at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, but since the beginning of July 2022, the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center was merged into the No. 3 Detention Center)* \n\n## **1. The One-Year Anniversary Review of the \"XueBing\" Case**\n\n### **1.1 XueBing were subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention for more than five months after their disappearance.**\n\nOn September 19, 2021, the Guangzhou police forcibly arrested XueBing on suspicion of \"inciting subversion of state power\" on the grounds that they had been organizing social gatherings at their home for a long time. Since then, the Guangzhou police never delivered the “Notice of Detention\" as required by law to the families of the two. It was not until April 1, 2022, when Wang met with his lawyer for the first time, that we learned that Wang had been illegally detained incommunicado in a location hitherto unknown for secret interrogation for at least five months, on the grounds of \"COVID prevention.” He was finally transferred to a collective detention center in the sixth month since his arrest. When detained incommunicado, Wang was subjected to dozens of grueling questioning, as well as both physical and psychological torturing, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL. By using Covid as an excuse, the Guangzhou police circumvented the use of RSDL, a measure that has been criticized heavily by the international community and the United Nations, on official written documents at least. Huang Xueqin was also held in a similar situation, but we were unable to obtain more specific details because she was deprived of her freedom of communication and access to a lawyer(s) of her choice over the past year.\n\nDuring his incommunicado detention, Wang Jianbing's physical and mental condition were exacerbated: he not only suffered from irregular diet and gastrointestinal disorders, but also mental fatigue and depression. Huang Xueqin lost 5kg (~11lb) in the first six months of her detention, given that she already weighed less than 50kg before her arrest.\n\n### **1.2 Huang Xueqin's lawyer was forced to withdraw and replaced by a government-appointed lawyer.**\n\nHuang's current situation in the detention center remains unknown. In late March 2022, Huang's family appointed Wan MiaoYan (万淼焱), one of Huang’s long-time friends, to represent her, and the engagement letter was sent to the detention center and signed by Huang. However, later in mid-April, the police suddenly presented a “termination letter” signed by Huang, claiming that Huang had terminated her engagement with Wan. In late April, Wan tried to go to the detention center to confirm the situation with Huang, but her request to meet with Huang was also denied by the detention center on the grounds of \"COVID prevention.” Huang has been represented by a government-appointed lawyer(s) since then.\n\nUntil now, Huang's family and friends still have no way of knowing her current condition because she has been deprived of freedom of communication. This is a very worrying situation. When she was last arrested in 2019 for documenting the \"Anti-Extradition Law Movement” protest in Hong Kong, she was represented by Wan Miaoyan too. However, this time, despite Huang having signed letter to engage Wan, Wan was quickly replaced by a government-appointed lawyer, which raises suspicions that Huang was coerced into making this decision.\n\n### **1.3 Civil society activists faced harassment, illegal interrogation and/or eviction.**\n\nSince XueBing’s arrest, the Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, have continued to issue local or cross-regional subpoenas or conduct interrogations. Over 70 of XueBing’s friends and gathering participants have been summoned by the police for interrogation, and, according to the preliminary statistics, among which more than 10 activists were evicted from or pressured to leave Guangzhou by the police through various means (such as pressure on landlords, intimidation of family members, continuous harassment of the activists, etc.). Without following legal procedure, the Guangzhou police interrogated the activists for up to 24 hours, some even multiple times, and forcibly searched and downloaded contents from their electronic devices. \n\nFurthermore, the police also forced and threatened some of XueBing’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police. They were forcibly asked to identify that XueBing had participated in the so-called training activities related to “subvert state power” and to fabricate the gathering at Jianbing’s apartment as a political event criticizing the government. The multiple written records the police have collected and produced over the last year consisted primarily of falsified testimonies signed by civil activists/friends of XueBing under duress, or outright fabrications by the police.\n\n## **2. The Latest Updates: the Case has been transferred to the court**\n\nAccording to various sources, we have learned that the case of Wang Jianbing has been transferred to the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on August 12, 2022, while the case of Huang Xueqin remains enshrouded. It is speculated that the two cases should now reach the court together without separate trials. According to Article 202 of the PRC *Criminal Procedural Law* , the court should conclude a case and come to a verdict no later than 180 days after the indictment is formally accepted. However, during the 180-day period of the first instance, the court may return the case to the Procuratorate Office again to conduct an additional investigation for a period up of to a month, after which the case will be resubmitted to the court with a fresh start of another 180 day.\n\nAlthough XueBing’s case has been transferred to court and is in its first instance, we are unable to estimate when the case would be tried. The PRC Criminal Procedure Law provides the judiciary with ample discretion power to prolong the hearing timing. However, we still can foresee that the trial of XueBing would be totally an unjust, government-directed, formalist and closed-door secret trial. At this stage, we believe that the two will extremely likely face immense political pressure, especially Huang Xueqin, who has even been deprived of the right to legal counsel, all this to make sure that the two would plead guilty to the absurd and unfounded charges on trial.\n\n## **3 Appeals from Friends of XueBing**\n\nIt has been six months since we lost contact with our beloved friends Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. During their darkest days in solitary confinement without access to lawyers, friends and family, we cannot imagine the kind of torture and humiliation they are going through. The tactics adopted by the Chinese authorities to suppress civil society and activists are clear by now—through continuously fabricating evidence, torturing the activist under solitary confinement (or RSDL), and cutting all means of communication and counsel with their lawyer, the authorities drag the case on and on until the activists *confess* to their supposed crime. We are enraged that XueBing have been going through such inhumane treatment.\n\nThe year-long incommunicado detention must have a huge detrimental impact on XueBing’s physical and mental health, which we, as their friends and family, have been deeply concerned about. However, we believe XueBing must still hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a crime, participating in #MeToo is not a crime, supporting workers is not a crime, and fighting for social justice should never be a crime!\n\nAs Friends of Huang and Wang:\n\n\\*We strongly condemn the arbitrary detention and criminal charges of Huang and Wang by the Guangzhou authorities. We demand that the authorities immediately disclose their physical and mental health conditions. The authorities must guarantee Huang’s access to legal counsel for her own choice without intimidation, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to communication and to a fair trial,  and their lawyers’ right to provide counsel and access to case files without intervention.\n\n\\*We strongly urge the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court to conduct an open trial rather than closed-door, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to legal representation and their lawyers’ basic right of defense, and initiate a strict scrutinization of the numerous fabricated ‘facts’ and ‘evidence’ associated with the case.\n\n\\*We are sincerely grateful to international NGOs, human rights organizations, media outlets and the global civil society community for their solidarity support to Huang and Wang. We believe, Huang and Wang would also very appreciate everyone’s continued concern on the situations of human rights abuse in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.\n\n\\*We deeply wish all of Huang and Wang’s friends and comrades in civil society who have been affected by this case to stay STRONG. Political repression will make us severely fearful, but only the unity, company and mutual support of each other can keep us strong and free. This is also what Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing have been working on in their struggle.\n\n## **4.

In the UK, [55 feminist scholars](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/11/55_scholars_support/) and [83 members of the UK University and College Union (UCU)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWshZFjBN5Qyn9TCEaRDS2HfTZV2o6JPWAA-vFjb1VVCemtg/viewform) respectively initiated and participated in a joint signature, demanding that the Chinese government immediately release Huang and Wang; [112 Chevening scholars](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/12/07/statement1208/) issued a joint statement expressing serious concern over the arbitrary detention and inability to visit the activists, and urged the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office and its Chevening Committee to speak out on the matter.\n\nd. Nearly 100 friends from all over the world sent [postcards](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2021/12/26/postcard_event/) to Huang and Wang, expressing their concern and blessings for them and protesting against the police illegality. In addition, supporters in London, Hong Kong, Taipei, the United Arab Emirates and other places wore [masks](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/02/05/xuebing_world/) of Huang and Wang to protest in various parts of the city, calling on the Chinese government to release the two.\n\ne. On the day of May 3, 2022, the World Press Freedom Day, a [social media campaign](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/05/03/pressday/) initiated by the human rights NGO ISHR, joining with half a dozen of other international NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, Front Line Defenders, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, etc, to show great concern on the situations of the imprisoned journalist Huang Xueqin, and call on the Chinese government release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing immediately and unconditionally.\n\nf. In [February 2022](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=27049), six of UN independent expert- including the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - sent a letter to the Chinese government expressing serious concern over Wang Jianbing’s enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention. [On April 1](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadFile?gId=36931), the Chinese government simply denied the allegation. [On May 11](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/A-HRC-WGAD-2022-9-CHN-AEV.pdf), the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention formally declared that Wang’s detention to be “arbitrary” and urged authorities to ensure his immediate release and access to remedy.\n\ng.

19, 2021, Human rights defenders <strong>Huang Xueqin</strong> and <strong>Wang Jianbing</strong> (“<em><strong>XueBing</strong></em>” for short) were forcibly arrested by the Guangzhou police on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. Using COVID as an excuse, they were held for at least five months in solitary confinement, and subjected to secret interrogation, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL., a form of detention that seriously violates international human rights principles.</p>\n<p>The weekly gatherings with friends that XueBing organized and participated in were characterized by the police as a threat to national security. Over the past year, the police have continually fabricated evidence based on these false accusations, coerced Huang into replacing her lawyer, interrogated and harassed dozens of civil activists. This further clamped down on China’s already weakened civil society.</p>\n<p>As of today, Huang Xueqin, the #MeToo activist and independent journalist, and Wang Jianbing, the labor rights advocate, have been arbitrarily detained for over a year. They were formally arrested on October 27, 2021, and transferred to the Procuratorate Office on March 27, 2022. After being returned for supplementary investigation twice, the case was finally submitted to the Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court for its first instance at mid-August 2022. The two are now being detained in the Guangzhou No. 3 Detention Center <em>(Previously, XueBing were detailed at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, but since the beginning of July 2022, the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center was merged into the No. 3 Detention Center)</em> </p>\n<h2 id=\"1-The-One-Year-Anniversary-Review-of-the-“XueBing”-Case\"><a href=\"#1-The-One-Year-Anniversary-Review-of-the-“XueBing”-Case\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1. The One-Year Anniversary Review of the “XueBing” Case\"></a><strong>1. The One-Year Anniversary Review of the “XueBing” Case</strong></h2><h3 id=\"1-1-XueBing-were-subjected-to-arbitrary-and-incommunicado-detention-for-more-than-five-months-after-their-disappearance\"><a href=\"#1-1-XueBing-were-subjected-to-arbitrary-and-incommunicado-detention-for-more-than-five-months-after-their-disappearance\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.1 XueBing were subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention for more than five months after their disappearance.\"></a><strong>1.1 XueBing were subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention for more than five months after their disappearance.</strong></h3><p>On September 19, 2021, the Guangzhou police forcibly arrested XueBing on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power” on the grounds that they had been organizing social gatherings at their home for a long time. Since then, the Guangzhou police never delivered the “Notice of Detention” as required by law to the families of the two. It was not until April 1, 2022, when Wang met with his lawyer for the first time, that we learned that Wang had been illegally detained incommunicado in a location hitherto unknown for secret interrogation for at least five months, on the grounds of “COVID prevention.” He was finally transferred to a collective detention center in the sixth month since his arrest. When detained incommunicado, Wang was subjected to dozens of grueling questioning, as well as both physical and psychological torturing, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL. By using Covid as an excuse, the Guangzhou police circumvented the use of RSDL, a measure that has been criticized heavily by the international community and the United Nations, on official written documents at least. Huang Xueqin was also held in a similar situation, but we were unable to obtain more specific details because she was deprived of her freedom of communication and access to a lawyer(s) of her choice over the past year.</p>\n<p>During his incommunicado detention, Wang Jianbing’s physical and mental condition were exacerbated: he not only suffered from irregular diet and gastrointestinal disorders, but also mental fatigue and depression. Huang Xueqin lost 5kg (~11lb) in the first six months of her detention, given that she already weighed less than 50kg before her arrest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-2-Huang-Xueqin’s-lawyer-was-forced-to-withdraw-and-replaced-by-a-government-appointed-lawyer\"><a href=\"#1-2-Huang-Xueqin’s-lawyer-was-forced-to-withdraw-and-replaced-by-a-government-appointed-lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.2 Huang Xueqin’s lawyer was forced to withdraw and replaced by a government-appointed lawyer.\"></a><strong>1.2 Huang Xueqin’s lawyer was forced to withdraw and replaced by a government-appointed lawyer.</strong></h3><p>Huang’s current situation in the detention center remains unknown. In late March 2022, Huang’s family appointed Wan MiaoYan (万淼焱), one of Huang’s long-time friends, to represent her, and the engagement letter was sent to the detention center and signed by Huang. However, later in mid-April, the police suddenly presented a “termination letter” signed by Huang, claiming that Huang had terminated her engagement with Wan. In late April, Wan tried to go to the detention center to confirm the situation with Huang, but her request to meet with Huang was also denied by the detention center on the grounds of “COVID prevention.” Huang has been represented by a government-appointed lawyer(s) since then.</p>\n<p>Until now, Huang’s family and friends still have no way of knowing her current condition because she has been deprived of freedom of communication. This is a very worrying situation. When she was last arrested in 2019 for documenting the “Anti-Extradition Law Movement” protest in Hong Kong, she was represented by Wan Miaoyan too. However, this time, despite Huang having signed letter to engage Wan, Wan was quickly replaced by a government-appointed lawyer, which raises suspicions that Huang was coerced into making this decision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-3-Civil-society-activists-faced-harassment-illegal-interrogation-and-or-eviction\"><a href=\"#1-3-Civil-society-activists-faced-harassment-illegal-interrogation-and-or-eviction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.3 Civil society activists faced harassment, illegal interrogation and/or eviction.\"></a><strong>1.3 Civil society activists faced harassment, illegal interrogation and/or eviction.</strong></h3><p>Since XueBing’s arrest, the Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, have continued to issue local or cross-regional subpoenas or conduct interrogations. Over 70 of XueBing’s friends and gathering participants have been summoned by the police for interrogation, and, according to the preliminary statistics, among which more than 10 activists were evicted from or pressured to leave Guangzhou by the police through various means (such as pressure on landlords, intimidation of family members, continuous harassment of the activists, etc.). Without following legal procedure, the Guangzhou police interrogated the activists for up to 24 hours, some even multiple times, and forcibly searched and downloaded contents from their electronic devices. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, the police also forced and threatened some of XueBing’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police. They were forcibly asked to identify that XueBing had participated in the so-called training activities related to “subvert state power” and to fabricate the gathering at Jianbing’s apartment as a political event criticizing the government. The multiple written records the police have collected and produced over the last year consisted primarily of falsified testimonies signed by civil activists/friends of XueBing under duress, or outright fabrications by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-The-Latest-Updates-the-Case-has-been-transferred-to-the-court\"><a href=\"#2-The-Latest-Updates-the-Case-has-been-transferred-to-the-court\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2. The Latest Updates: the Case has been transferred to the court\"></a><strong>2. The Latest Updates: the Case has been transferred to the court</strong></h2><p>According to various sources, we have learned that the case of Wang Jianbing has been transferred to the Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court on August 12, 2022, while the case of Huang Xueqin remains enshrouded. It is speculated that the two cases should now reach the court together without separate trials. According to Article 202 of the PRC <em>Criminal Procedural Law</em> , the court should conclude a case and come to a verdict no later than 180 days after the indictment is formally accepted. However, during the 180-day period of the first instance, the court may return the case to the Procuratorate Office again to conduct an additional investigation for a period up of to a month, after which the case will be resubmitted to the court with a fresh start of another 180 day.</p>\n<p>Although XueBing’s case has been transferred to court and is in its first instance, we are unable to estimate when the case would be tried. The PRC Criminal Procedure Law provides the judiciary with ample discretion power to prolong the hearing timing. However, we still can foresee that the trial of XueBing would be totally an unjust, government-directed, formalist and closed-door secret trial. At this stage, we believe that the two will extremely likely face immense political pressure, especially Huang Xueqin, who has even been deprived of the right to legal counsel, all this to make sure that the two would plead guilty to the absurd and unfounded charges on trial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-Appeals-from-Friends-of-XueBing\"><a href=\"#3-Appeals-from-Friends-of-XueBing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3 Appeals from Friends of XueBing\"></a><strong>3 Appeals from Friends of XueBing</strong></h2><p>It has been six months since we lost contact with our beloved friends Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. During their darkest days in solitary confinement without access to lawyers, friends and family, we cannot imagine the kind of torture and humiliation they are going through. The tactics adopted by the Chinese authorities to suppress civil society and activists are clear by now—through continuously fabricating evidence, torturing the activist under solitary confinement (or RSDL), and cutting all means of communication and counsel with their lawyer, the authorities drag the case on and on until the activists <em>confess</em> to their supposed crime. We are enraged that XueBing have been going through such inhumane treatment.</p>\n<p>The year-long incommunicado detention must have a huge detrimental impact on XueBing’s physical and mental health, which we, as their friends and family, have been deeply concerned about. However, we believe XueBing must still hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a crime, participating in #MeToo is not a crime, supporting workers is not a crime, and fighting for social justice should never be a crime!</p>\n<p>As Friends of Huang and Wang:</p>\n<p>*We strongly condemn the arbitrary detention and criminal charges of Huang and Wang by the Guangzhou authorities. We demand that the authorities immediately disclose their physical and mental health conditions. The authorities must guarantee Huang’s access to legal counsel for her own choice without intimidation, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to communication and to a fair trial,  and their lawyers’ right to provide counsel and access to case files without intervention.</p>\n<p>*We strongly urge the Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court to conduct an open trial rather than closed-door, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to legal representation and their lawyers’ basic right of defense, and initiate a strict scrutinization of the numerous fabricated ‘facts’ and ‘evidence’ associated with the case.</p>\n<p>*We are sincerely grateful to international NGOs, human rights organizations, media outlets and the global civil society community for their solidarity support to Huang and Wang. We believe, Huang and Wang would also very appreciate everyone’s continued concern on the situations of human rights abuse in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.</p>\n<p>*We deeply wish all of Huang and Wang’s friends and comrades in civil society who have been affected by this case to stay STRONG. Political repression will make us severely fearful, but only the unity, company and mutual support of each other can keep us strong and free. This is also what Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing have been working on in their struggle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-How-to-Support-XueBing\"><a href=\"#4-How-to-Support-XueBing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"4.

19, 2021, Human rights defenders <strong>Huang Xueqin</strong> and <strong>Wang Jianbing</strong> (“<em><strong>XueBing</strong></em>” for short) were forcibly arrested by the Guangzhou police on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”. Using COVID as an excuse, they were held for at least five months in solitary confinement, and subjected to secret interrogation, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL., a form of detention that seriously violates international human rights principles.</p>\n<p>The weekly gatherings with friends that XueBing organized and participated in were characterized by the police as a threat to national security. Over the past year, the police have continually fabricated evidence based on these false accusations, coerced Huang into replacing her lawyer, interrogated and harassed dozens of civil activists. This further clamped down on China’s already weakened civil society.</p>\n<p>As of today, Huang Xueqin, the #MeToo activist and independent journalist, and Wang Jianbing, the labor rights advocate, have been arbitrarily detained for over a year. They were formally arrested on October 27, 2021, and transferred to the Procuratorate Office on March 27, 2022. After being returned for supplementary investigation twice, the case was finally submitted to the Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court for its first instance at mid-August 2022. The two are now being detained in the Guangzhou No. 3 Detention Center <em>(Previously, XueBing were detailed at Guangzhou No.1 Detention Center, but since the beginning of July 2022, the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center was merged into the No. 3 Detention Center)</em> </p>\n<h2 id=\"1-The-One-Year-Anniversary-Review-of-the-“XueBing”-Case\"><a href=\"#1-The-One-Year-Anniversary-Review-of-the-“XueBing”-Case\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1. The One-Year Anniversary Review of the “XueBing” Case\"></a><strong>1. The One-Year Anniversary Review of the “XueBing” Case</strong></h2><h3 id=\"1-1-XueBing-were-subjected-to-arbitrary-and-incommunicado-detention-for-more-than-five-months-after-their-disappearance\"><a href=\"#1-1-XueBing-were-subjected-to-arbitrary-and-incommunicado-detention-for-more-than-five-months-after-their-disappearance\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.1 XueBing were subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention for more than five months after their disappearance.\"></a><strong>1.1 XueBing were subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention for more than five months after their disappearance.</strong></h3><p>On September 19, 2021, the Guangzhou police forcibly arrested XueBing on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power” on the grounds that they had been organizing social gatherings at their home for a long time. Since then, the Guangzhou police never delivered the “Notice of Detention” as required by law to the families of the two. It was not until April 1, 2022, when Wang met with his lawyer for the first time, that we learned that Wang had been illegally detained incommunicado in a location hitherto unknown for secret interrogation for at least five months, on the grounds of “COVID prevention.” He was finally transferred to a collective detention center in the sixth month since his arrest. When detained incommunicado, Wang was subjected to dozens of grueling questioning, as well as both physical and psychological torturing, in conditions similar to those of ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, or RSDL. By using Covid as an excuse, the Guangzhou police circumvented the use of RSDL, a measure that has been criticized heavily by the international community and the United Nations, on official written documents at least. Huang Xueqin was also held in a similar situation, but we were unable to obtain more specific details because she was deprived of her freedom of communication and access to a lawyer(s) of her choice over the past year.</p>\n<p>During his incommunicado detention, Wang Jianbing’s physical and mental condition were exacerbated: he not only suffered from irregular diet and gastrointestinal disorders, but also mental fatigue and depression. Huang Xueqin lost 5kg (~11lb) in the first six months of her detention, given that she already weighed less than 50kg before her arrest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-2-Huang-Xueqin’s-lawyer-was-forced-to-withdraw-and-replaced-by-a-government-appointed-lawyer\"><a href=\"#1-2-Huang-Xueqin’s-lawyer-was-forced-to-withdraw-and-replaced-by-a-government-appointed-lawyer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.2 Huang Xueqin’s lawyer was forced to withdraw and replaced by a government-appointed lawyer.\"></a><strong>1.2 Huang Xueqin’s lawyer was forced to withdraw and replaced by a government-appointed lawyer.</strong></h3><p>Huang’s current situation in the detention center remains unknown. In late March 2022, Huang’s family appointed Wan MiaoYan (万淼焱), one of Huang’s long-time friends, to represent her, and the engagement letter was sent to the detention center and signed by Huang. However, later in mid-April, the police suddenly presented a “termination letter” signed by Huang, claiming that Huang had terminated her engagement with Wan. In late April, Wan tried to go to the detention center to confirm the situation with Huang, but her request to meet with Huang was also denied by the detention center on the grounds of “COVID prevention.” Huang has been represented by a government-appointed lawyer(s) since then.</p>\n<p>Until now, Huang’s family and friends still have no way of knowing her current condition because she has been deprived of freedom of communication. This is a very worrying situation. When she was last arrested in 2019 for documenting the “Anti-Extradition Law Movement” protest in Hong Kong, she was represented by Wan Miaoyan too. However, this time, despite Huang having signed letter to engage Wan, Wan was quickly replaced by a government-appointed lawyer, which raises suspicions that Huang was coerced into making this decision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-3-Civil-society-activists-faced-harassment-illegal-interrogation-and-or-eviction\"><a href=\"#1-3-Civil-society-activists-faced-harassment-illegal-interrogation-and-or-eviction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.3 Civil society activists faced harassment, illegal interrogation and/or eviction.\"></a><strong>1.3 Civil society activists faced harassment, illegal interrogation and/or eviction.</strong></h3><p>Since XueBing’s arrest, the Guangzhou police, in conjunction with public security departments across the country, have continued to issue local or cross-regional subpoenas or conduct interrogations. Over 70 of XueBing’s friends and gathering participants have been summoned by the police for interrogation, and, according to the preliminary statistics, among which more than 10 activists were evicted from or pressured to leave Guangzhou by the police through various means (such as pressure on landlords, intimidation of family members, continuous harassment of the activists, etc.). Without following legal procedure, the Guangzhou police interrogated the activists for up to 24 hours, some even multiple times, and forcibly searched and downloaded contents from their electronic devices. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, the police also forced and threatened some of XueBing’s friends to sign false statements fabricated by the police. They were forcibly asked to identify that XueBing had participated in the so-called training activities related to “subvert state power” and to fabricate the gathering at Jianbing’s apartment as a political event criticizing the government. The multiple written records the police have collected and produced over the last year consisted primarily of falsified testimonies signed by civil activists/friends of XueBing under duress, or outright fabrications by the police.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-The-Latest-Updates-the-Case-has-been-transferred-to-the-court\"><a href=\"#2-The-Latest-Updates-the-Case-has-been-transferred-to-the-court\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2. The Latest Updates: the Case has been transferred to the court\"></a><strong>2. The Latest Updates: the Case has been transferred to the court</strong></h2><p>According to various sources, we have learned that the case of Wang Jianbing has been transferred to the Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court on August 12, 2022, while the case of Huang Xueqin remains enshrouded. It is speculated that the two cases should now reach the court together without separate trials. According to Article 202 of the PRC <em>Criminal Procedural Law</em> , the court should conclude a case and come to a verdict no later than 180 days after the indictment is formally accepted. However, during the 180-day period of the first instance, the court may return the case to the Procuratorate Office again to conduct an additional investigation for a period up of to a month, after which the case will be resubmitted to the court with a fresh start of another 180 day.</p>\n<p>Although XueBing’s case has been transferred to court and is in its first instance, we are unable to estimate when the case would be tried. The PRC Criminal Procedure Law provides the judiciary with ample discretion power to prolong the hearing timing. However, we still can foresee that the trial of XueBing would be totally an unjust, government-directed, formalist and closed-door secret trial. At this stage, we believe that the two will extremely likely face immense political pressure, especially Huang Xueqin, who has even been deprived of the right to legal counsel, all this to make sure that the two would plead guilty to the absurd and unfounded charges on trial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-Appeals-from-Friends-of-XueBing\"><a href=\"#3-Appeals-from-Friends-of-XueBing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3 Appeals from Friends of XueBing\"></a><strong>3 Appeals from Friends of XueBing</strong></h2><p>It has been six months since we lost contact with our beloved friends Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. During their darkest days in solitary confinement without access to lawyers, friends and family, we cannot imagine the kind of torture and humiliation they are going through. The tactics adopted by the Chinese authorities to suppress civil society and activists are clear by now—through continuously fabricating evidence, torturing the activist under solitary confinement (or RSDL), and cutting all means of communication and counsel with their lawyer, the authorities drag the case on and on until the activists <em>confess</em> to their supposed crime. We are enraged that XueBing have been going through such inhumane treatment.</p>\n<p>The year-long incommunicado detention must have a huge detrimental impact on XueBing’s physical and mental health, which we, as their friends and family, have been deeply concerned about. However, we believe XueBing must still hold on to the belief that being a journalist is not a crime, participating in #MeToo is not a crime, supporting workers is not a crime, and fighting for social justice should never be a crime!</p>\n<p>As Friends of Huang and Wang:</p>\n<p>*We strongly condemn the arbitrary detention and criminal charges of Huang and Wang by the Guangzhou authorities. We demand that the authorities immediately disclose their physical and mental health conditions. The authorities must guarantee Huang’s access to legal counsel for her own choice without intimidation, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to communication and to a fair trial,  and their lawyers’ right to provide counsel and access to case files without intervention.</p>\n<p>*We strongly urge the Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court to conduct an open trial rather than closed-door, ensure Huang and Wang’s right to legal representation and their lawyers’ basic right of defense, and initiate a strict scrutinization of the numerous fabricated ‘facts’ and ‘evidence’ associated with the case.</p>\n<p>*We are sincerely grateful to international NGOs, human rights organizations, media outlets and the global civil society community for their solidarity support to Huang and Wang. We believe, Huang and Wang would also very appreciate everyone’s continued concern on the situations of human rights abuse in China. We call on more international groups to continue to pay attention to and support the deeply suppressed Chinese human rights defenders.</p>\n<p>*We deeply wish all of Huang and Wang’s friends and comrades in civil society who have been affected by this case to stay STRONG. Political repression will make us severely fearful, but only the unity, company and mutual support of each other can keep us strong and free. This is also what Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing have been working on in their struggle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-How-to-Support-XueBing\"><a href=\"#4-How-to-Support-XueBing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"4.

**1.** 回顾消失的一年：两人被任意羁押，雪琴被迫撤换律师，公民社会伙伴遭遇警方骚扰/审讯/逼迁\n\n### **1.1** 雪饼两人强迫失踪后遭遇五个多月的单独关押。\n\n2021年9月19日，广州警方以两人长期在家中组织社会聚会为由，以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”强行抓捕了两人，且一直未给家属寄送法律规定的“拘留通知书”。直至2022年4月1日，王建兵与律师首次会见才得知，建兵于被捕后的五个多月内被警方以“疫情隔离”的名义在迄今无人知晓的地点进行非法的单独关押审讯，直到第六个月才转回看守所集体关押。王建兵在单独关押期间遭受了数十次的疲劳审讯和来自身心灵多方面的肉体和精神折磨——这与“指定居所监视居住（指监，RSDL）”的实际关押情形无异，但警方通过这种方式规避了在书面文件上使用备受国际社会及联合国批评的“指监”措施。黄雪琴的羁押情况类似，但因其过去一年间被严重剥夺通讯自由和律师会见权利，我们无法获知更多的具体细节。王建兵在被单独关押期间身心状况极受影响，不仅饮食不规律、肠胃功能变差，而且精神疲糜、深受抑郁症困扰；黄雪琴被关押的前半年，体重骤减5kg（11lb），而其本人被捕前已经很瘦，体重原本不及50kg。\n\n### **1.2** 黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\n\n2022年3月下旬，黄家人委托的黄雪琴长期好友兼律师万淼焱为其代表律师，委托函同时送至看守所获黄雪琴本人亲自签名。但4月中旬，警方突然提供一份由黄雪琴签字的“解除律师声明”，声称解除了万律师的委托授权；万律师在4月下旬欲前往看守所与雪琴确认，但其会见申请也被看守所以“防疫”缘由拒绝。如今，黄雪琴代理律师已改由政府指派的律师代理，因其本人的通讯自由也被违法剥夺，家人和外界均无法得知黄雪琴关押近一年来的处境。此种情况非常令人担忧。黄雪琴于2019年因记录香港“反送中”运动第一次被捕时，其代表律师亦为其友人万淼焱；但此次在签署委托书后又迅速被撤换，不禁让人怀疑这是黄雪琴在被胁迫、非自愿情况下做出的不得已决定。\n\n### **1.3** 公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\n\n自雪饼被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地警方，针对与雪饼相关的公民社会伙伴们持续进行了本地或跨地区的骚扰、传唤或审讯。据不完全统计，有超过70位雪饼朋友或家庭聚会参与者被传唤做笔录，其中亦有超过10位行动者被警方通过各种手段（如施压房东、恐吓家属、持续骚扰当事人等）要求搬离广州。广州警察在没有出示任何合法手续情况下，即对部分公民社会行动者进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓，且强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。更甚的是，警方强迫和威胁部分雪饼朋友签署由警方编造的虚假口供，要求他们指认雪饼两人曾参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，并将王建兵家中的聚会捏造为批评政府的“政治性聚会”。过去一年，警方在侦查阶段采集、形成的多份笔录资料，基本都是警方单一编造的内容，或是在非法情形下胁迫部分聚会参与者/公民社会行动者签署下的虚假说明。雪饼两人的政治遭遇，正是中国政府对公民社会网络的持续强力打压的缩影。\n\n## **2** 案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\n\n我们从各渠道获知，王建兵案件在8月12日首次移送广州市中级人民法院，而黄雪琴的情况仍然处于黑洞。推测在不分案的情况下，两人案件现在应该一起到达法院受理阶段。根据《刑事诉讼法》第202条规定，若法院受理案件，应该最晚在180天内审结并判决。而在这180天的一审阶段，法院仍然可以将案件退回人民检察院进行补充侦查（至长一个月），然后重新送回法院重新计算开庭日期。\n\n尽管雪饼案已经移送法院进入到第一审阶段，但我们仍然无法预测案件何时终了落地。中国的《刑事诉讼法》给当局预留了太多自由裁量权和拖延庭审的空间，我们仍然无法预估此案何时会开庭，我们也可预见雪饼案将会是一个不公开、不公平、自编自导自演的一个庭审。在这个阶段，相信迎接雪饼的会是同样巨大的政治压力，尤其是黄雪琴，连自由聘请自己辩护律师的权力都被剥夺。这都是为了迫使和确保两人在最后庭审现场中能认罪认罚，承认本不存在的荒谬控罪。\n\n##

来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\n\n雪饼两人与我们已经整整失联一年了。在暗无天日、单独关押、甚至没有律师会见的日子里，我们完全无法想象她们正在遭遇怎样的酷刑和羞辱。如今，中国政府打压公民社会和行动者的策略非常地明显，通过对外不断地罗织罪证、在内通过单独关押内发生的酷刑折磨，亦切断行动者与律师的沟通和会见渠道，通过不断的拖延时间来迫使行动者承认莫须有的罪名。雪饼正在遭遇这些非人道的对待，我们无比愤怒！\n\n一年的关押对她们的身心影响绝对是巨大的，我们这些朋友和家人一直都在深切担心着她们的身心健康。我们相信，雪饼一定还在坚持信念，身为记者不是一个罪，参与#MeToo不是一个罪，支持工人不是一个罪，关注社会公义从来都不应该是一个罪！\n\n作为雪饼的朋友：\n\n\\*我们严厉谴责广州警方和政府对雪饼两人的肆意抓捕和无理控罪，我们要求政府立即披露两人的身心健康情况，确保黄雪琴委托律师不受干涉，保障两人被羁押期间基本的自由通讯权、保障代理律师的会见权阅卷权，以及公平审判权。\n\n\\*我们强烈要求广州市中级人民法院，对本案进行公开审理，保障两人及律师基本的辩护权，对案件所涉莫须有的事实和众多非法证据进行严格审查。\n\n\\*我们感激国际公益组织、人权机构、社会媒体和国际公民社会对于雪饼两人的声援和帮助。我们相信，她们两人也非常感激大家对于中国人权状况的的持续关注。我们呼吁更多的国际团体继续关注和支持深受打压的中国人权捍卫者。\n\n\\*我们希望所有受到影响的雪饼的朋友和公民社会的伙伴能够保持坚强。政治的打压会让我们深陷恐惧，只有共同团结和守望相助才能让我们保持力量和自由，这也是雪饼一直以来在努力的事情。\n\n## **4** 你可以怎么声援/支持雪饼？\n\n或许争取释放雪饼的道路将非常艰巨，但是我们的每一个行动和努力将有助于大大提高社会公众和国际社会对雪饼的关注，这些压力必然会帮助到改善雪饼在狱中的生存处境和获得更多有尊严的对待。每一个小行动很重要！\n\nA) 请你为关押于广州市第三看守所的黄雪琴和王建兵写一封明信片，并在寄送明信片的同时拍照留存寄送到我们电子邮箱（重要）。\n\n

Rights Now](https://hrn.or.jp/eng/news/2022/03/16/hrc49_oral_statement_on_china_hrds/)和[International Service for Human Rights](https://twitter.com/FreeXueBing/status/1502135567919820803) 在联合国人权理事会中发言，呼吁人权高专办（OHCHR）关注雪饼事件，要求中国政府释放两人。\n\n（2）[2022年2月](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=27049)，联合国人权捍卫者处境特别报告员和任意羁押问题工作组等专家小组向中国政府发信，对王建兵的强迫失踪和任意羁押表严重关切，并指出该抓捕违反国际人权法。[4月1日](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadFile?gId=36931)，中国政府回复拒绝了该项指控。[5月11日](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/A-HRC-WGAD-2022-9-CHN-AEV.pdf)，联合国任意羁押问题工作组继而发表对王建兵案件的官方看法，工作组认定对王建兵的剥夺自由行为属于任意羁押，要求中国政府立即释放王建兵。\n\n（3）[2022年5月3日世界新闻自由日](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/05/03/pressday/)，人权组织ISHR联合多家国际机构，包括无国界记者、前线卫士、中国人权捍卫者等多个组织，共同声援独立记者黄雪琴，并呼吁中国政府立即、无条件地释放黄雪琴和王建兵。\n\n（4）2022年5月，黄雪琴获得长期关注言论自由的非政府组织“审查指数”(Index on Censorship) 提名为2022年度[“言论自由奖”之新闻业三位候选人之一](https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2022/05/journalism-2022/)。该奖项用于致敬全世界那些在捍卫言论自由前线的行动者们，黄雪琴被视为其中重要的一个代表——她的性别报道和对受害者的支援掀起了中国 #MenToo 运动的开端。\n\n（5）2022年6月，黄雪琴获得由国际女性媒体基金(IWMF)颁发的2022年度[“沃利斯安能堡”女性记者正义奖](https://www.iwmf.org/community/xueqin-sophia-huang/)，旨在表彰具有非凡的坚持和勇敢的女记者。该奖赞赏雪琴在她记者生涯中对于社会不公义和腐败的揭露，以及在中国 #MeToo 运动扮演的先导者角色。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8LZmCcN.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ewdQ6O1.png)","source":"_posts/365.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: 【雪饼一年】行动者黄雪琴和王建兵（“雪饼”）被捕一年声明\ndate:

雪饼两人强迫失踪后遭遇五个多月的单独关押。\n\n2021年9月19日，广州警方以两人长期在家中组织社会聚会为由，以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”强行抓捕了两人，且一直未给家属寄送法律规定的“拘留通知书”。直至2022年4月1日，王建兵与律师首次会见才得知，建兵于被捕后的五个多月内被警方以“疫情隔离”的名义在迄今无人知晓的地点进行非法的单独关押审讯，直到第六个月才转回看守所集体关押。王建兵在单独关押期间遭受了数十次的疲劳审讯和来自身心灵多方面的肉体和精神折磨——这与“指定居所监视居住（指监，RSDL）”的实际关押情形无异，但警方通过这种方式规避了在书面文件上使用备受国际社会及联合国批评的“指监”措施。黄雪琴的羁押情况类似，但因其过去一年间被严重剥夺通讯自由和律师会见权利，我们无法获知更多的具体细节。王建兵在被单独关押期间身心状况极受影响，不仅饮食不规律、肠胃功能变差，而且精神疲糜、深受抑郁症困扰；黄雪琴被关押的前半年，体重骤减5kg（11lb），而其本人被捕前已经很瘦，体重原本不及50kg。\n\n### **1.2** 黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\n\n2022年3月下旬，黄家人委托的黄雪琴长期好友兼律师万淼焱为其代表律师，委托函同时送至看守所获黄雪琴本人亲自签名。但4月中旬，警方突然提供一份由黄雪琴签字的“解除律师声明”，声称解除了万律师的委托授权；万律师在4月下旬欲前往看守所与雪琴确认，但其会见申请也被看守所以“防疫”缘由拒绝。如今，黄雪琴代理律师已改由政府指派的律师代理，因其本人的通讯自由也被违法剥夺，家人和外界均无法得知黄雪琴关押近一年来的处境。此种情况非常令人担忧。黄雪琴于2019年因记录香港“反送中”运动第一次被捕时，其代表律师亦为其友人万淼焱；但此次在签署委托书后又迅速被撤换，不禁让人怀疑这是黄雪琴在被胁迫、非自愿情况下做出的不得已决定。\n\n### **1.3** 公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\n\n自雪饼被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地警方，针对与雪饼相关的公民社会伙伴们持续进行了本地或跨地区的骚扰、传唤或审讯。据不完全统计，有超过70位雪饼朋友或家庭聚会参与者被传唤做笔录，其中亦有超过10位行动者被警方通过各种手段（如施压房东、恐吓家属、持续骚扰当事人等）要求搬离广州。广州警察在没有出示任何合法手续情况下，即对部分公民社会行动者进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓，且强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。更甚的是，警方强迫和威胁部分雪饼朋友签署由警方编造的虚假口供，要求他们指认雪饼两人曾参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，并将王建兵家中的聚会捏造为批评政府的“政治性聚会”。过去一年，警方在侦查阶段采集、形成的多份笔录资料，基本都是警方单一编造的内容，或是在非法情形下胁迫部分聚会参与者/公民社会行动者签署下的虚假说明。雪饼两人的政治遭遇，正是中国政府对公民社会网络的持续强力打压的缩影。\n\n## **2** 案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\n\n我们从各渠道获知，王建兵案件在8月12日首次移送广州市中级人民法院，而黄雪琴的情况仍然处于黑洞。推测在不分案的情况下，两人案件现在应该一起到达法院受理阶段。根据《刑事诉讼法》第202条规定，若法院受理案件，应该最晚在180天内审结并判决。而在这180天的一审阶段，法院仍然可以将案件退回人民检察院进行补充侦查（至长一个月），然后重新送回法院重新计算开庭日期。\n\n尽管雪饼案已经移送法院进入到第一审阶段，但我们仍然无法预测案件何时终了落地。中国的《刑事诉讼法》给当局预留了太多自由裁量权和拖延庭审的空间，我们仍然无法预估此案何时会开庭，我们也可预见雪饼案将会是一个不公开、不公平、自编自导自演的一个庭审。在这个阶段，相信迎接雪饼的会是同样巨大的政治压力，尤其是黄雪琴，连自由聘请自己辩护律师的权力都被剥夺。这都是为了迫使和确保两人在最后庭审现场中能认罪认罚，承认本不存在的荒谬控罪。\n\n## **3** 来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\n\n雪饼两人与我们已经整整失联一年了。在暗无天日、单独关押、甚至没有律师会见的日子里，我们完全无法想象她们正在遭遇怎样的酷刑和羞辱。如今，中国政府打压公民社会和行动者的策略非常地明显，通过对外不断地罗织罪证、在内通过单独关押内发生的酷刑折磨，亦切断行动者与律师的沟通和会见渠道，通过不断的拖延时间来迫使行动者承认莫须有的罪名。雪饼正在遭遇这些非人道的对待，我们无比愤怒！\n\n一年的关押对她们的身心影响绝对是巨大的，我们这些朋友和家人一直都在深切担心着她们的身心健康。我们相信，雪饼一定还在坚持信念，身为记者不是一个罪，参与#MeToo不是一个罪，支持工人不是一个罪，关注社会公义从来都不应该是一个罪！\n\n作为雪饼的朋友：\n\n\\*我们严厉谴责广州警方和政府对雪饼两人的肆意抓捕和无理控罪，我们要求政府立即披露两人的身心健康情况，确保黄雪琴委托律师不受干涉，保障两人被羁押期间基本的自由通讯权、保障代理律师的会见权阅卷权，以及公平审判权。\n\n\\*我们强烈要求广州市中级人民法院，对本案进行公开审理，保障两人及律师基本的辩护权，对案件所涉莫须有的事实和众多非法证据进行严格审查。\n\n\\*我们感激国际公益组织、人权机构、社会媒体和国际公民社会对于雪饼两人的声援和帮助。我们相信，她们两人也非常感激大家对于中国人权状况的的持续关注。我们呼吁更多的国际团体继续关注和支持深受打压的中国人权捍卫者。\n\n\\*我们希望所有受到影响的雪饼的朋友和公民社会的伙伴能够保持坚强。政治的打压会让我们深陷恐惧，只有共同团结和守望相助才能让我们保持力量和自由，这也是雪饼一直以来在努力的事情。\n\n## **4** 你可以怎么声援/支持雪饼？\n\n或许争取释放雪饼的道路将非常艰巨，但是我们的每一个行动和努力将有助于大大提高社会公众和国际社会对雪饼的关注，这些压力必然会帮助到改善雪饼在狱中的生存处境和获得更多有尊严的对待。每一个小行动很重要！\n\nA) 请你为关押于广州市第三看守所的黄雪琴和王建兵写一封明信片，并在寄送明信片的同时拍照留存寄送到我们电子邮箱（重要）。\n\n

Rights Now](https://hrn.or.jp/eng/news/2022/03/16/hrc49_oral_statement_on_china_hrds/)和[International Service for Human Rights](https://twitter.com/FreeXueBing/status/1502135567919820803) 在联合国人权理事会中发言，呼吁人权高专办（OHCHR）关注雪饼事件，要求中国政府释放两人。\n\n（2）[2022年2月](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=27049)，联合国人权捍卫者处境特别报告员和任意羁押问题工作组等专家小组向中国政府发信，对王建兵的强迫失踪和任意羁押表严重关切，并指出该抓捕违反国际人权法。[4月1日](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadFile?gId=36931)，中国政府回复拒绝了该项指控。[5月11日](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/A-HRC-WGAD-2022-9-CHN-AEV.pdf)，联合国任意羁押问题工作组继而发表对王建兵案件的官方看法，工作组认定对王建兵的剥夺自由行为属于任意羁押，要求中国政府立即释放王建兵。\n\n（3）[2022年5月3日世界新闻自由日](https://free-xueq-jianb.github.io/2022/05/03/pressday/)，人权组织ISHR联合多家国际机构，包括无国界记者、前线卫士、中国人权捍卫者等多个组织，共同声援独立记者黄雪琴，并呼吁中国政府立即、无条件地释放黄雪琴和王建兵。\n\n（4）2022年5月，黄雪琴获得长期关注言论自由的非政府组织“审查指数”(Index on Censorship) 提名为2022年度[“言论自由奖”之新闻业三位候选人之一](https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2022/05/journalism-2022/)。该奖项用于致敬全世界那些在捍卫言论自由前线的行动者们，黄雪琴被视为其中重要的一个代表——她的性别报道和对受害者的支援掀起了中国 #MenToo 运动的开端。\n\n（5）2022年6月，黄雪琴获得由国际女性媒体基金(IWMF)颁发的2022年度[“沃利斯安能堡”女性记者正义奖](https://www.iwmf.org/community/xueqin-sophia-huang/)，旨在表彰具有非凡的坚持和勇敢的女记者。该奖赞赏雪琴在她记者生涯中对于社会不公义和腐败的揭露，以及在中国 #MeToo 运动扮演的先导者角色。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8LZmCcN.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ewdQ6O1.png)","slug":"365","published":1,"updated":"2022-09-19T09:30:15.051Z","_id":"cl87j796c0001ugk249fudiwa","comments":1,"photos":[],"link":"","content":"<!--\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[if

class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.1 雪饼两人强迫失踪后遭遇五个多月的单独关押。\"></a><strong>1.1</strong> 雪饼两人强迫失踪后遭遇五个多月的单独关押。</h3><p>2021年9月19日，广州警方以两人长期在家中组织社会聚会为由，以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”强行抓捕了两人，且一直未给家属寄送法律规定的“拘留通知书”。直至2022年4月1日，王建兵与律师首次会见才得知，建兵于被捕后的五个多月内被警方以“疫情隔离”的名义在迄今无人知晓的地点进行非法的单独关押审讯，直到第六个月才转回看守所集体关押。王建兵在单独关押期间遭受了数十次的疲劳审讯和来自身心灵多方面的肉体和精神折磨——这与“指定居所监视居住（指监，RSDL）”的实际关押情形无异，但警方通过这种方式规避了在书面文件上使用备受国际社会及联合国批评的“指监”措施。黄雪琴的羁押情况类似，但因其过去一年间被严重剥夺通讯自由和律师会见权利，我们无法获知更多的具体细节。王建兵在被单独关押期间身心状况极受影响，不仅饮食不规律、肠胃功能变差，而且精神疲糜、深受抑郁症困扰；黄雪琴被关押的前半年，体重骤减5kg（11lb），而其本人被捕前已经很瘦，体重原本不及50kg。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-2-黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\"><a href=\"#1-2-黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.2 黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\"></a><strong>1.2</strong> 黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。</h3><p>2022年3月下旬，黄家人委托的黄雪琴长期好友兼律师万淼焱为其代表律师，委托函同时送至看守所获黄雪琴本人亲自签名。但4月中旬，警方突然提供一份由黄雪琴签字的“解除律师声明”，声称解除了万律师的委托授权；万律师在4月下旬欲前往看守所与雪琴确认，但其会见申请也被看守所以“防疫”缘由拒绝。如今，黄雪琴代理律师已改由政府指派的律师代理，因其本人的通讯自由也被违法剥夺，家人和外界均无法得知黄雪琴关押近一年来的处境。此种情况非常令人担忧。黄雪琴于2019年因记录香港“反送中”运动第一次被捕时，其代表律师亦为其友人万淼焱；但此次在签署委托书后又迅速被撤换，不禁让人怀疑这是黄雪琴在被胁迫、非自愿情况下做出的不得已决定。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-3-公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\"><a href=\"#1-3-公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.3 公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\"></a><strong>1.3</strong> 公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。</h3><p>自雪饼被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地警方，针对与雪饼相关的公民社会伙伴们持续进行了本地或跨地区的骚扰、传唤或审讯。据不完全统计，有超过70位雪饼朋友或家庭聚会参与者被传唤做笔录，其中亦有超过10位行动者被警方通过各种手段（如施压房东、恐吓家属、持续骚扰当事人等）要求搬离广州。广州警察在没有出示任何合法手续情况下，即对部分公民社会行动者进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓，且强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。更甚的是，警方强迫和威胁部分雪饼朋友签署由警方编造的虚假口供，要求他们指认雪饼两人曾参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，并将王建兵家中的聚会捏造为批评政府的“政治性聚会”。过去一年，警方在侦查阶段采集、形成的多份笔录资料，基本都是警方单一编造的内容，或是在非法情形下胁迫部分聚会参与者/公民社会行动者签署下的虚假说明。雪饼两人的政治遭遇，正是中国政府对公民社会网络的持续强力打压的缩影。</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\"><a href=\"#2-案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2 案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\"></a><strong>2</strong> 案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院</h2><p>我们从各渠道获知，王建兵案件在8月12日首次移送广州市中级人民法院，而黄雪琴的情况仍然处于黑洞。推测在不分案的情况下，两人案件现在应该一起到达法院受理阶段。根据《刑事诉讼法》第202条规定，若法院受理案件，应该最晚在180天内审结并判决。而在这180天的一审阶段，法院仍然可以将案件退回人民检察院进行补充侦查（至长一个月），然后重新送回法院重新计算开庭日期。</p>\n<p>尽管雪饼案已经移送法院进入到第一审阶段，但我们仍然无法预测案件何时终了落地。中国的《刑事诉讼法》给当局预留了太多自由裁量权和拖延庭审的空间，我们仍然无法预估此案何时会开庭，我们也可预见雪饼案将会是一个不公开、不公平、自编自导自演的一个庭审。在这个阶段，相信迎接雪饼的会是同样巨大的政治压力，尤其是黄雪琴，连自由聘请自己辩护律师的权力都被剥夺。这都是为了迫使和确保两人在最后庭审现场中能认罪认罚，承认本不存在的荒谬控罪。</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\"><a href=\"#3-来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3 来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\"></a><strong>3</strong> 来自雪饼朋友的呼吁</h2><p>雪饼两人与我们已经整整失联一年了。在暗无天日、单独关押、甚至没有律师会见的日子里，我们完全无法想象她们正在遭遇怎样的酷刑和羞辱。如今，中国政府打压公民社会和行动者的策略非常地明显，通过对外不断地罗织罪证、在内通过单独关押内发生的酷刑折磨，亦切断行动者与律师的沟通和会见渠道，通过不断的拖延时间来迫使行动者承认莫须有的罪名。雪饼正在遭遇这些非人道的对待，我们无比愤怒！</p>\n<p>一年的关押对她们的身心影响绝对是巨大的，我们这些朋友和家人一直都在深切担心着她们的身心健康。我们相信，雪饼一定还在坚持信念，身为记者不是一个罪，参与#MeToo不是一个罪，支持工人不是一个罪，关注社会公义从来都不应该是一个罪！</p>\n<p>作为雪饼的朋友：</p>\n<p>*我们严厉谴责广州警方和政府对雪饼两人的肆意抓捕和无理控罪，我们要求政府立即披露两人的身心健康情况，确保黄雪琴委托律师不受干涉，保障两人被羁押期间基本的自由通讯权、保障代理律师的会见权阅卷权，以及公平审判权。</p>\n<p>*我们强烈要求广州市中级人民法院，对本案进行公开审理，保障两人及律师基本的辩护权，对案件所涉莫须有的事实和众多非法证据进行严格审查。</p>\n<p>*我们感激国际公益组织、人权机构、社会媒体和国际公民社会对于雪饼两人的声援和帮助。我们相信，她们两人也非常感激大家对于中国人权状况的的持续关注。我们呼吁更多的国际团体继续关注和支持深受打压的中国人权捍卫者。</p>\n<p>*我们希望所有受到影响的雪饼的朋友和公民社会的伙伴能够保持坚强。政治的打压会让我们深陷恐惧，只有共同团结和守望相助才能让我们保持力量和自由，这也是雪饼一直以来在努力的事情。</p>\n<h2

你可以怎么声援/支持雪饼？</h2><p>或许争取释放雪饼的道路将非常艰巨，但是我们的每一个行动和努力将有助于大大提高社会公众和国际社会对雪饼的关注，这些压力必然会帮助到改善雪饼在狱中的生存处境和获得更多有尊严的对待。每一个小行动很重要！</p>\n<p>A)

href=\"https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=27049\">2022年2月</a>，联合国人权捍卫者处境特别报告员和任意羁押问题工作组等专家小组向中国政府发信，对王建兵的强迫失踪和任意羁押表严重关切，并指出该抓捕违反国际人权法。<a href=\"https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadFile?gId=36931\">4月1日</a>，中国政府回复拒绝了该项指控。<a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/A-HRC-WGAD-2022-9-CHN-AEV.pdf\">5月11日</a>，联合国任意羁押问题工作组继而发表对王建兵案件的官方看法，工作组认定对王建兵的剥夺自由行为属于任意羁押，要求中国政府立即释放王建兵。</p>\n<p>（3）<a

class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.1 雪饼两人强迫失踪后遭遇五个多月的单独关押。\"></a><strong>1.1</strong> 雪饼两人强迫失踪后遭遇五个多月的单独关押。</h3><p>2021年9月19日，广州警方以两人长期在家中组织社会聚会为由，以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权罪”强行抓捕了两人，且一直未给家属寄送法律规定的“拘留通知书”。直至2022年4月1日，王建兵与律师首次会见才得知，建兵于被捕后的五个多月内被警方以“疫情隔离”的名义在迄今无人知晓的地点进行非法的单独关押审讯，直到第六个月才转回看守所集体关押。王建兵在单独关押期间遭受了数十次的疲劳审讯和来自身心灵多方面的肉体和精神折磨——这与“指定居所监视居住（指监，RSDL）”的实际关押情形无异，但警方通过这种方式规避了在书面文件上使用备受国际社会及联合国批评的“指监”措施。黄雪琴的羁押情况类似，但因其过去一年间被严重剥夺通讯自由和律师会见权利，我们无法获知更多的具体细节。王建兵在被单独关押期间身心状况极受影响，不仅饮食不规律、肠胃功能变差，而且精神疲糜、深受抑郁症困扰；黄雪琴被关押的前半年，体重骤减5kg（11lb），而其本人被捕前已经很瘦，体重原本不及50kg。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-2-黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\"><a href=\"#1-2-黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.2 黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。\"></a><strong>1.2</strong> 黄雪琴代理律师被迫撤换为官派律师，现狱中处境不明。</h3><p>2022年3月下旬，黄家人委托的黄雪琴长期好友兼律师万淼焱为其代表律师，委托函同时送至看守所获黄雪琴本人亲自签名。但4月中旬，警方突然提供一份由黄雪琴签字的“解除律师声明”，声称解除了万律师的委托授权；万律师在4月下旬欲前往看守所与雪琴确认，但其会见申请也被看守所以“防疫”缘由拒绝。如今，黄雪琴代理律师已改由政府指派的律师代理，因其本人的通讯自由也被违法剥夺，家人和外界均无法得知黄雪琴关押近一年来的处境。此种情况非常令人担忧。黄雪琴于2019年因记录香港“反送中”运动第一次被捕时，其代表律师亦为其友人万淼焱；但此次在签署委托书后又迅速被撤换，不禁让人怀疑这是黄雪琴在被胁迫、非自愿情况下做出的不得已决定。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-3-公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\"><a href=\"#1-3-公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.3 公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。\"></a><strong>1.3</strong> 公民社会伙伴遭遇警方多番骚扰、审讯及逼迁。</h3><p>自雪饼被抓后，广州警方联动全国多地警方，针对与雪饼相关的公民社会伙伴们持续进行了本地或跨地区的骚扰、传唤或审讯。据不完全统计，有超过70位雪饼朋友或家庭聚会参与者被传唤做笔录，其中亦有超过10位行动者被警方通过各种手段（如施压房东、恐吓家属、持续骚扰当事人等）要求搬离广州。广州警察在没有出示任何合法手续情况下，即对部分公民社会行动者进行了多次长达24小时的审讯和恐吓，且强行搜查和拷贝电子设备。更甚的是，警方强迫和威胁部分雪饼朋友签署由警方编造的虚假口供，要求他们指认雪饼两人曾参与过“颠覆国家政权”的所谓培训活动，并将王建兵家中的聚会捏造为批评政府的“政治性聚会”。过去一年，警方在侦查阶段采集、形成的多份笔录资料，基本都是警方单一编造的内容，或是在非法情形下胁迫部分聚会参与者/公民社会行动者签署下的虚假说明。雪饼两人的政治遭遇，正是中国政府对公民社会网络的持续强力打压的缩影。</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\"><a href=\"#2-案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2 案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院\"></a><strong>2</strong> 案件进展和下一步程序：已移送法院</h2><p>我们从各渠道获知，王建兵案件在8月12日首次移送广州市中级人民法院，而黄雪琴的情况仍然处于黑洞。推测在不分案的情况下，两人案件现在应该一起到达法院受理阶段。根据《刑事诉讼法》第202条规定，若法院受理案件，应该最晚在180天内审结并判决。而在这180天的一审阶段，法院仍然可以将案件退回人民检察院进行补充侦查（至长一个月），然后重新送回法院重新计算开庭日期。</p>\n<p>尽管雪饼案已经移送法院进入到第一审阶段，但我们仍然无法预测案件何时终了落地。中国的《刑事诉讼法》给当局预留了太多自由裁量权和拖延庭审的空间，我们仍然无法预估此案何时会开庭，我们也可预见雪饼案将会是一个不公开、不公平、自编自导自演的一个庭审。在这个阶段，相信迎接雪饼的会是同样巨大的政治压力，尤其是黄雪琴，连自由聘请自己辩护律师的权力都被剥夺。这都是为了迫使和确保两人在最后庭审现场中能认罪认罚，承认本不存在的荒谬控罪。</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\"><a href=\"#3-来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3 来自雪饼朋友的呼吁\"></a><strong>3</strong> 来自雪饼朋友的呼吁</h2><p>雪饼两人与我们已经整整失联一年了。在暗无天日、单独关押、甚至没有律师会见的日子里，我们完全无法想象她们正在遭遇怎样的酷刑和羞辱。如今，中国政府打压公民社会和行动者的策略非常地明显，通过对外不断地罗织罪证、在内通过单独关押内发生的酷刑折磨，亦切断行动者与律师的沟通和会见渠道，通过不断的拖延时间来迫使行动者承认莫须有的罪名。雪饼正在遭遇这些非人道的对待，我们无比愤怒！</p>\n<p>一年的关押对她们的身心影响绝对是巨大的，我们这些朋友和家人一直都在深切担心着她们的身心健康。我们相信，雪饼一定还在坚持信念，身为记者不是一个罪，参与#MeToo不是一个罪，支持工人不是一个罪，关注社会公义从来都不应该是一个罪！</p>\n<p>作为雪饼的朋友：</p>\n<p>*我们严厉谴责广州警方和政府对雪饼两人的肆意抓捕和无理控罪，我们要求政府立即披露两人的身心健康情况，确保黄雪琴委托律师不受干涉，保障两人被羁押期间基本的自由通讯权、保障代理律师的会见权阅卷权，以及公平审判权。</p>\n<p>*我们强烈要求广州市中级人民法院，对本案进行公开审理，保障两人及律师基本的辩护权，对案件所涉莫须有的事实和众多非法证据进行严格审查。</p>\n<p>*我们感激国际公益组织、人权机构、社会媒体和国际公民社会对于雪饼两人的声援和帮助。我们相信，她们两人也非常感激大家对于中国人权状况的的持续关注。我们呼吁更多的国际团体继续关注和支持深受打压的中国人权捍卫者。</p>\n<p>*我们希望所有受到影响的雪饼的朋友和公民社会的伙伴能够保持坚强。政治的打压会让我们深陷恐惧，只有共同团结和守望相助才能让我们保持力量和自由，这也是雪饼一直以来在努力的事情。</p>\n<h2

卅八生日自嘲\n\n三十而立立未得，四十不惑惑益生；\n\n清夢早隨春水遠，油膩漸共腹圍增；\n\n蠻觸戰，蠅蝸名，滄浪濯足亦濯纓；\n\n欲問前程君看取，蛤蜊將盡盤將空。\n\n辛丑六月初五日\n\n2021.7.14\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2. 行道芒\n\n就那樣\n\n靜靜立著 綠著\n\n靜靜開完花\n\n靜靜結了果\n\n直到\n\n一顆顆孤零零的果子\n\n從空中探下頭\n\n才有人指點著 認出它們\n\n從其餘的綠蔭中\n\n就像一顆顆孤零零的心\n\n懸著 在風吹雨打日曬里\n\n小心翼翼地 長大\n\n長出柔軟的身體\n\n在緊繃的皮和堅硬的核之間\n\n那讓它們\n\n不惜 皮開肉綻\n\n粉身碎骨 而奮身躍下的\n\n到底是什麼？\n\n2021.6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n### 3. 無題\n\n腐史盲丘意幾深\n\n忤時媚世每交侵\n\n八街鬼哭殤無祭\n\n九折軒回路待尋\n\n宋國高風六鹢退\n\n雁門雰雪四愁吟\n\n古來鹿馬殊難辨\n\n欲起董狐鉤隱沈\n\n2021.6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n### 4. 有寄\n\n鬥心病體每相妨，亂緒幽懷元自傷；\n\n老大嗟余窮入骨，多情笑爾髮侵霜；\n\n百年身世繁鶯語，萬里塵途幾雁行；\n\n嶺海花殘春已去，憑欄風雨正猖狂。\n\n2021.4.27\n\n\n\n\n\n### 5. 辛丑上元小陰雨攜三妹遊園\n\n偏是今年節侯早，春光不覺滿天涯；\n\n鱗波洗眼深深綠，時雨隨風怯怯斜；\n\n坐看魚兒吹水沫，尤憐鳧子繞荷花；\n\n閒情暫放塵心遠，啼鳥聲中乘物華。\n\n2021.2.27\n\n\n\n\n\n### 6. 辛丑人日閒坐二首\n\n其一\n\n佳節羊城又一經，天涯倦客慣浮萍；\n\n白衣斑駁驚心淚，舊句披離燭夜螢；\n\n大患有身兼有我，曉夢如醉複如醒；\n\n難遣閒愁隨柳絮，春色無邊深掩扃。\n\n\n\n其二\n\n不馴龍性嵇中散，長哭窮途阮步兵；\n\n古豈無人悲永夜，今當有恨入鵑聲；\n\n宜時難學三緘口，避地偏慳一夢清；\n\n問說蘇門千載下，松杉尤作鳳鸞鳴。\n\n2021.2.18\n\n\n\n\n\n### 7. 初六日送窮聯\n\n揚雄早逐，韓愈復送；奈何我行爾動，我靜爾休，嘆古來君子亦有；\n\n叔向曾賀，顏回能安；偏是彼眾我寡，彼盈我竭，到今日小人得無。\n\n2021.2.17\n\n\n\n\n\n### 8.無題\n\n翹彥絕倫，自有義行燭暗夜；\n\n楚琴慷慨，由來大道厄孤標。\n\n2021.2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n### 9. 有寄\n\n庚子殘年劫未消，忽聞傳信動悲憀；\n\n只緣閔會隔銀漢，翻化魯牢成鵲橋；\n\n馬蹶塵飛鼙鼓咽，風狂日暗赤旗飄；\n\n欲將此恨傾杯酒，四壁無聲夜寂寥。\n\n2021.2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n### 10 有寄\n\n零丁風雨倍淒涼，賈禍知君拚熱腸；\n\n盛世歌吹文字獄，何人血淚自由章；\n\n日移潮落魚還躍，雲壓天低鶴未藏；\n\n莫道冬寒方徹骨，冰消浪起看春江。\n\n2021.1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n### 11. 霜降日饮茶有感\n\n去夏携友买洞庭绿茶，当时大爱其气馥色鲜；\n\n所余少许，今日试饮之，则色香俱失，唯余苦味耳。\n\n秋风吹鬓乱如麻\n\n素袖淄尘此路赊\n\n最是芳华留不住\n\n苦余偏沏旧年茶\n\n2020.10.23\n\n\n\n\n\n### 12. 庚子客中七夕\n\n一夕別離重一秋，人間天上說綢繆；\n\n可憐最是銀河鵲，歲歲年年不自由。\n\n2020.8.25\n\n\n\n\n\n### 13. 羈中逢生日無聊自解一首\n\n高陽疫使滿人間，海國羈留學坐禪；\n\n簾綴浮雲天一角，窗喧鳥語論三千；\n\n看花每見戧風雨，寄命今逢庚子年；\n\n茵溷早知非可計，何勞禱祝問因緣。\n\n2020.7.25\n\n\n\n\n\n### 14. 有感\n\n雲雨氍毹每出奇\n\n常聞仙樂和壎篪\n\n大人方續沐猴冠\n\n君子新裁相鼠皮\n\n莪者菁菁餘酒飯\n\n風兮獵獵擁旌旗\n\n愁他樹倒猢猻散\n\n公案三千堪問誰\n\n庚子端陽\n\n2020.6.25\n\n\n\n\n\n### 15. 有感\n\n舞袖笙歌喧画楼；但看绝顶白云浮。\n\n青鸾北降传天敕；仙客南参拜玉丘。\n\n金鼎悄悄烟火色；碧莲戚戚美人头。\n\n劝君莫怨龙舟水；风雨苍茫无限愁。\n\n2020.6.20\n\n\n\n\n\n### 16. 有感\n\n珠帘宝篆几重深；惯看风花浮玉樽。\n\n偏是杜鹃啼梦断；丹墀新降小黄门。\n\n2020.06.13\n\n\n\n\n\n### 17. 无 题\n\n默祭国殇重一年；九州含咽倍凄然。\n\n青春有梦堙沧海；赤血无声染杜鹃。\n\n北极陨霜寒彻地；南溟怒浪势滔天。\n\n试看冰解雪消后；信有千夫催战舷。\n\n2020.6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n### 18.\n\n素袖新塵掩舊塵\n\n驚心歲月又殘春\n\n青驢呼向趙州過\n\n尤作邯鄲夢裡人\n\n2020.4.30\n\n-呼应2018.4.29的诗词\n\n\n### 19.《暮春》\n\n怒紫飞黄终作尘\n\n怅闻风雨送残春\n\n方酣一枕邯郸梦\n\n谁见当年吕道人\n\n\n\n### 20. 庚子年春节联\n\n猪瘟，鼠疫，肺炎；辟谣，抓人，封城；\n\n哭九州生民倒悬，劝诸君莫向人多处去；\n\n富强，文明，民主；自由，和谐，法治；\n\n笑一派强国崛起，看盛世只从美梦中来。\n\n横批：居家隔离\n\n给大家拜年，各自珍重！\n\n2020.1.24\n\n\n\n\n### 21. 《跨年夜獨坐寄祥子》\n\n獨對昏燈聽雨聲，倥傯歲月幾心驚。\n\n黃粱夢續徒空幻，赤鬼歌喧競太平。\n\n鐵壁藏形龍虎蟄，荒原含怒火星明。\n\n思君此日身何處，長夜無言氣縱橫。\n\n2020.1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n### 22. 新春拜年！\n\n春生戌亥交岁除；但看爆竹，飞腾起漫天烟火；\n\n气转龙蛇动山泽；且待惊雷，震荡开四野风云。\n\n2019.2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n### 23.\n\n死去原非万事空，但悲尤是九州红。\n\n待看瓦解冰消日，白铁三千拜鬼雄。\n\n2018.12.17\n\n\n\n\n\n### 24.
