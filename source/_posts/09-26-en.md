Women’s rights journalist Huang Xueqin and occupational disease rights advocate Wang Jianbing (nicknamed “Pancake”) were found to be missing at the same time on September 19th. The two originally planned to go to Shenzhen from Guangzhou on September 20th. Huang had planned to depart from the Hong Kong airport by entering HK border through the Shenzhen port, whereas Wang was simply to see her off.  Multiple sources confirmed that Guangzhou police are currently holding both Huang and Wang in police custody. Huang and Wang were suspected to be detained for the charge of "inciting subversion of state power". The police have likely imposed “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) " on both of them. Sources revealed that the police likely based their suspicion of the two solely on the weekly gatherings in Wang Jianbing's place. Both Huang and Wang have been missing for over a week as of today.

## Case details

Sources revealed that at around 3pm on September 19, the Guangzhou police took Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin, who was leaving to study overseas, in Wang Jianbing's rented apartment (located at Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou) by force, and confiscated their personal belongings.

Meanwhile, a rented apartment located in ChangZhou in Huangpu District of Guangzhou used by a friend of Wang Jianbing for storage was broken in and searched unlawfully by the police in the afternoon of September 20th. A number of personal belongings and items were taken by the police as a result.

Multiple sources were able to confirmed that the main reason for Huang and Wang’s detention may be connected to the weekly friendly gatherings in Wang's place. From September 19 to September 25, Guangzhou police have unlawfully taken some of the people who used to attend the gatherings at Wang Jianbing (Pancake)’s place into the police station. The police have asked them to corroborate the police’s theory of Huang and Wang being the organizers of political discussions and activities. These people were each held by the police for 24 hours of questioning.

All of the police’s theories and allegations of Huang and Wang were completely false. According to those who have attended the gatherings at Wang Jianbing's place, Pancake is someone that is kind-hearted and selfless. The gatherings were casual in nature, as people felt safe to share about their weeks and receive emotional support from each other. The police’s allegation that Huang and Wang were plotting to commit the crime of “inciting subversion of state power” at these friendly gatherings isn’t just completely unfounded, but also unfathomable and outrageous. 

It has been nearly a week since their disappearance. The police refused to reveal any information about Huang and Wang to their families and friends. It became evident that the two were not detained in any detention centers in Guangdong Province. The whereabouts of the two who were suspected to be kept under “residential surveillance in a designated location” is not known to families and friends, nor are the states of their physical and mental well-beings.

Families and friends of Huang and Wang strongly demand the police to disclose informations regarding their detention and release them as soon as possible! In the meantime, we demand that the police to stop the unlawful detentions and interrogations of Huang and Wang’s acquaintances at once!
