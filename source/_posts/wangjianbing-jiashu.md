由王建兵家属委托的贵州萧云阳律师日前向广州警方申请会见和取保候审；11月19日获知，办案机关均拒绝了相关申请。而家属此前亦多次尝试给关押中的建兵汇款，都显示失败。家属呼吁广州公安允许律师会见王建兵，确认他是否真的在看守所以及健康状况。

### 这是家属的呼吁：

2021年10月16日，我们家属委托贵州萧云阳律师为王建兵辨护。萧律师于10月20日到广州，21日见到了广州市公安局的办案王警官，并向办案机关递交了委托手续。2021年11月5日，我们家属收到逮捕通知书，通知书上载明：2021年10月27日，广州市检察院批准逮捕王建兵，罪名是煽动颠覆国家政权。

我们不相信建兵有做违反任何国家法律法规的事情，因此要求萧律师会见王建兵并申请取保候审。2021年11月19日，萧律师告诉我们，申请已知递交办案机关，但办案机关没有批准律师会见及取保候审申请。

建兵被关押两个多月了，见不到人真是心急！我们通过“粤省事”小程序给在广州市第一看守所的建兵汇款，无数次都显示“审核不通过”，现在也不知道建兵是否真的在看守所、情况怎么样、身体是否健康？真希望广州市公安局能够同意律师会见，我们家属真的很着急。

Wang Jianbing’s lawyer Xiao Yunqiang recently filed an application to the Guangzhou Police for a lawyer visit and request Wang to be released on bail. On Nov. 19, it was learned that the authority rejected the request. Also, Wang’s family have tried many times to remit money to him online for custody use, of which have been rejected too. The family NOW appealed to the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau for the lawyer visit permission, and wishes to confirm whether Wang is really in the detention center and his health conditions.

### Below is the Appeal from Wang’s family (11/21):

On Oct. 16, 2021, our family entrusted Lawyer Xiao Yunyang to defend Wang Jianbing. Lawyer Xiao went to Guangzhou on Oct. 20, and met Police Officer Mr. Wang from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau on Oct. 21. Lawyer Xiao also submitted the entrustment procedures to the case handling agency. On Nov. 5, 2021, our family members received a Notice of Arrest. The Notice stated: On Oct. 27, 2021, the Guangzhou Procuratorate approved the arrest of Wang Jianbing on charges of inciting subversion of state power.

We do not believe that Jianbing has done anything that violates any laws and regulations, so we ask Lawyer Xiao to request a visit with Jianbing and apply for bail. On Nov. 19, 2021, Lawyer Xiao told us that the case handling agency approved neither the lawyer’s visit request nor the bail application.

Jianbing has been imprisoned for more than two months. Nor being allowed to see him frustrates our whole family! We have tried many times to remit money to Jianbing, who is supposed to be at the No. 1 Detention Center in Guangzhou, through the online detention remittance system-"Guangdong Provincial Affairs". However, it has been shown that "the review failed" countless times. Now we don't even know if Jianbing is really in the detention center (because of the failed remittance). What is his current state? Whether he is in a good health condition? We really hope that the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau can approve the lawyer's visit application. Our family is really anxious NOW!
