Free Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing!

We, members of the UK’s University and College Union (UCU), are calling on the Chinese authorities to release without delay Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.

Huang is a well-known investigative journalist and #Metoo activist in China who was preparing to travel to the UK to undertake postgraduate study at the University of Sussex. Wang is a veteran workers’ and disability rights activist. Both are based in Guangdong province and were detained by the authorities on 19 September 2021. 

They have since been formally charged with “inciting subversion of state power”. Amnesty International states that Huang Xueqin’s arrest shines “a light on the dire treatment of victims of sexual violence [and] also exemplifies the Chinese authorities’ hostility towards journalists who dare to report the truth”. Amnesty further stated: “Wang Jianbing, who has advocated for workers with disabilities and occupational diseases, is also facing a lengthy jail sentence on the same bogus ‘subversion’ charge. No one should face jail simply for defending workers’ rights.”

We call for Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing to be released immediately and unconditionally. We urge the entire UK labour movement to speak out and to raise its voice in support of our sister and brother activists in China.
