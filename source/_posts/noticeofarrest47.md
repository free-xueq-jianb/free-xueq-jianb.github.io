11月5日，王建兵家属收到广州市公安局发出的“逮捕通知书”，逮捕公函号为特殊的穗公捕通字[2021]X2。该通知书显示王建兵已于10月27日被广州市公安局以涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”的名义被执行逮捕，现拘留于广州市第一看守所。黄雪琴家属也拿到了相关通知。

王建兵和黄雪琴于2021年9月19日被警方强行抓捕后，广州警方以国家安全为由，拒绝通知家属们任何案件程序性信息，也拒绝家属进入王建兵被抄住所收拾物品，并要求家属对案件保持沉默，更以核实律师身份名义拒绝律师会见申请。此为建兵消失47天后家人第一次获知其涉案情况。获知逮捕后，亲友尝试通过网上监所汇款系统欲给“雪饼”二人存钱，均显示“审核不通过”，汇款失败。

On Nov. 5, Wang Jianbing’s family received a “Notice of Arrest”, with a special letter No.[2021]X2 issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, informing that he had been accused of “Incited Subversion of State Power”. According to the notice, Wang has been detained since Sep. 19 and officially arrested on Oct. 27 and is now detained in Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center. Huang (Sophia) Xueqin's family received similar notice too.

After Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin were forcibly disappeared on Sep. 19, 2021, the Guangzhou police deployed national security concerns as a “justification”, refusing to provide the family any information related to their charge, location, or any procedural information about the case. They also refused to let Wang’s family member enter his apartment, requested the family to remain silent on the case, and refused Wang’s lawyer's application for visiting in the name of “verifying the identity of the lawyer”. This is the first time that Jianbing's family has been informed of his situation 47 days after his forcible disappearance. After being informed of the arrest, relatives and friends tried to deposit money for the two through the online prison remittance system, but both showed "verification failed" and the remittance failed.
