雪饼案最新消息：从家属获知，女权活动家黄雪琴和劳工行动者王建兵“煽动颠覆国家政权”一案将于本周五6月14日上午10时在广州市中级人民法院 开庭宣判，两人或将面临严重刑罚。雪饼遭警方任意羁押即将届满1000天，合法权益一直无法保障，历经闭门审判，这将是一个极为荒谬的恶意判决。请关注！

雪饼两人自2021年9月19日失去自由，关押两年后于2023年9月22日才正式开庭一审。开庭前夕法院门口周边连夜封路，警车和警察散布路口。尽管号称公开审判，一审当天不允许任何人聚集和围观，更遑论进入法院。当天开庭，雪饼两人拒绝承认所做所为有错，当天法院未宣判。

在一审最后陈述中，王建兵表示："我认为，我自己没有要去颠覆国家政权，也没想过要煽动颠覆国家政权。我关注的，更多的是职业病工人的社会问题。” 

黄雪琴表示：“作为一名记者，我做不到保持沉默。我也知道自己不安全，迟早有一天会面对这样的状况，但需要承担的后果，我愿意承担。”

针对警方的恶意控告，乱编罪名，黄雪琴自陈：“我写的文章、所做的采访均是真实存在的社会现象。没有歪曲事实，也没有攻击国家和政府，我所做的一切，不是要去煽动颠覆国家政权，(而)是希望社会能够改良，变得更好,让国家变得更好。”

雪饼两人为劳工、女性权益乃至民间社群的所付出的努力和心血，不会因这场不公义的审判而被否认，也不会让社会因此忘记ta们的存在。恰恰相反，当压迫持续，不公在滋生，只会有更多像雪饼一样的行动者继续站出来。

Breaking: Verdict will be announced. The sentences for feminist activist HuangXueqin and labor activist WangJianbing, accused of "inciting subversion of state power", will be announced on 10 am, June 14, 2024 at Guangzhou Intermediate Court. They could face severe penalties. 

Since Sept. 19, 2021, XueBing have been detained for nearly 1000 days with most of their legal rights repeatedly violated. The two faced their first trial on Sept. 22, 2023, 2 years after their arbitrary detention, amidst tight security. Despite claiming an open trial, no public attendance was allowed by the authorities.

In court, the two denied any wrongdoing. WangJianbing emphasized his sincere sympathy on migrant workers with occupational disease, while HuangXueqin stressed her commitment to reporting true social issues and defending women's rights. This would be an absurd & malicious verdict!

On the trial of Sept. 22, 2023, WangJianbing concluded: "I state that my activism doesn’t intend to subvert state power, nor do I want to incite subversion of state power. What I care about is the social issues concerning migrant workers with occupational diseases."

And, HuangXueqin concluded: "As a journalist, I cannot remain silent. I always know that I'm not safe & will face such a situation sooner or later, but I am willing to bear the political consequences."

HuangXueqin reiterated that, "The articles I wrote and the interviews I conducted were all factual social phenomena. I did not distort the facts, nor did I use them to attack the government. Everything I do is not to incite subversion of state power..."

XueBing's efforts and dedication to labor, women's rights, and the broader civil society won't be negated by this unjust trial, nor will society forget their contributions.  On the contrary, as oppression persists and injustice grows, more activists like XueBing will continue to rise. We invite everyone to leave messages for them, expressing support & love here:
