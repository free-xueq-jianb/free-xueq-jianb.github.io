Latest news: The police informed that Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (XueBing) were officially transferred to the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate for examination and prosecution on 27 March 2022.

According to Articles 37 and 38 of the Criminal Procedure Law, defence lawyers can meet and correspond with their clients and verify relevant case evidence from the date the procuratorate examines the case for prosecution; they can also inspect, extract and copy the case file materials related to the case. The Guangzhou police never allowed XueBing's lawyers to meet with them during the more than six months of investigation and detention, on the grounds that national security was involved. Now that the investigation has been completed, we expect XueBing's lawyers to be able to read and meet with them without any problems.

We have also learned that XueBing has been transferred back into custody at Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Centre. Previously, according to sources, Xueqin had been privately transferred to the Second Detention Centre or other places for months of incommunicado interrogation without informing his family and lawyers. Jianbing had also been held in solitary confinement for interrogation in other facilities for several months. It is reported that in the last month they have been retransferred to the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Centre (Hougang North Street, Baiyun District, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province).
