经确认，雪饼两人已经正式向广东高院提起上诉。黄雪琴在宣判当天就表示要上诉，并已完成后续上诉流程，其表示无论未来二审结果如何，都将持续申诉到底；王建兵则对部分判决提起了上诉。

此前，2024年6月14日，广州中院一审宣判，判处两人所谓“煽动颠覆国家政权”罪成立。黄雪琴被判5年，王建兵被判3年6个月，并被处以巨额罚款。该判决主要针对两人日常的的公共观点表达和批判性言论、以及近年来在国内试图建立青年行动者网络的努力。宣判时，法官并没有给两人陈述和发言的机会，也没有询问其上诉意愿。黄雪琴趁着宣判间隙，表示不服判决，将上诉；王建兵当场没有机会表态。

雪饼在二审期间，仍继续被关押在广州市第一看守所。两人迄今已被任意羁押长达1018天。据悉，两人目前状态不错。煎饼（王建兵）请大家不要担心他，只是看守所的生活难熬，他希望可以收到一些诗词方面的书籍。雪琴意志坚定，一直坚持锻炼，还为在押人士争取到了改善饮食、洗热水澡等权益。

#AppealUpdates It has been confirmed that Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (“XueBing”) have formally appealed to the Higher People's Court of Guangdong Province. Huang expressed her intention to appeal on the day of the verdict hearing, and has subsequently completed the appeal process, stating that regardless of the outcome of the second-instance in the future, she will continue to appeal to the end through all legal means. Wang has appealed part of the verdict.

Previously, on June 14, 2024, the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court handed down a first-instance verdict convicting the two of "inciting subversion of state power..” Huang was sentenced to five years and Wang was sentenced to three years and six months. Both were fined substantial amounts. The sentence was to penalize the two’s daily expression of social criticism and practice their freedom of expression, as well as their attempts in recent years to (re)build a network of young activists in China, where civic space has shrunk dramatically. During the hearing, the judge did not give the two an opportunity to make a statement, nor did the judge ask them if they wished to appeal. Huang took advantage of a break in the hearing to explicitly say that she did not accept the verdict and would appeal; Wang eventually didn't get a chance to take a stand on the spot.

Huang and Wang will continue to be detained at the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center until the second instance concludes. So far, the two have been arbitrarily detained for 1018 days. It is reported that the two are currently in good condition. Wang asked friends not to worry about him. It's just that life in the detention center is tough, and he wishes he could receive some books on ancient Chinese poetry and classic literature. Huang is strong-willed and has been consistently exercising. She has also fought for some improvements for the detainees, including better meals and hot baths.

Finally, for those of you who have XueBing on your mind and want to send your support and love to them, you can: 1) leave your encouragement and support on the Padlet webpage, which they will surely see on the day of their freedom: [https://padlet.com/freexqjb/xuebing](https://padlet.com/freexqjb/xuebing) ; and 2) send them a book or a postcard.
