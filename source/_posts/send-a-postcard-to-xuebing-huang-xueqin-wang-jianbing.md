Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing (referred together as "Xuebing") are an independent journalist and labour activist in mainland China, respectively. They were taken from their homes by the police in September 2021 and are currently being held in secret detention. In the past three months since their disappearance, the police did not inform their families of the charges, nor did they give the families a notice, while asking the families to keep quiet and summoning their friends to make false statements, deliberately framing them for "inciting subversion of state power”.

It has been more than three months since Xuebing disappeared. Lawyers still have not been able to see them, and their actual place of detention remains unknown. We are a group of friends of Xuebing and would like to initiate a postcard campaign at the end of 2021, inviting everyone to send postcards to Xuebing.

Whether you know them in person or not, and whether these postcards will actually be delivered to them or not, the action itself is significantly meaningful and can help critically improve their situations — it is a gesture to tell the authorities that we are strongly concerned about Xuebing’s conditions, and we are closely watching what injustice and illegality you have done to our friends!

We invite everyone to join our campaign. It can be a New Year's greeting or just a simple wish to Xuebing, or a protest to the police. Let's express our concern, thoughts, wishes and protests for Xeubing’s case in the coming New Year.

【Cause for Xuebing's arrest】

According to friends who were interrogated, the so-called "subversion" by the police refers to the friends' gatherings that Wang Jianbing would often host at his home. The theme of the gatherings were merely daily life sharing and companying of depressed communities, with little to no connection to the state or the regime, unless the state considers companionship to be a crime.

He was the project manager of rural education program at Western Sunshine Foundation for 5 years.
