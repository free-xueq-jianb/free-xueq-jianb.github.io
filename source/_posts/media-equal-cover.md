我们呼吁媒体和NGO团体平衡报道“雪饼”
Call for Equal-Handed Coverage on #XueBing

我们观察到，大多数关于“雪饼案”的媒体报道和机构声明主要集中在女权行动者黄雪琴身上，而同案的劳工行动者王建兵，仅仅被简单提及或是被完全忽略。对于这一不均衡的报道，我们感到遗憾。作为雪琴和煎饼（建兵）的朋友，我们呼吁媒体和民间团体可以平衡报道黄雪琴和王建兵，毕竟两人都受到了同等不公和严厉的惩罚。

引发“雪饼案”的一个关键政治诱因，是劳工行动者王建兵每周四在其家中组织的日常聚会。在经历了过去十多年公民社会的低沉和挫败后，煎饼认为在这些艰难时期重新凝结社群、促进青年行动者的网络和互助是至关重要的。他希望通过定期聚会的方式重新建立连结、探索新的公民社群行动方式。雪琴和建兵两人在重建广州的公民社会中都共同发挥了至关重要的作用，理应获得同样的尊重和平衡报道。

We have observed that most media coverage and statements predominantly focuses on #HuangXueqin, while #WangJianbing, the low-profile labor activist, involved in the same case, is often only briefly mentioned or overlooked entirely.
We regret this uneven coverage of the #XueBing case and, as friends of both #HuangXueqin and #WangJianbing, call on the media and organizations to provide even-handed coverage of the two, both of whom have faced unjust and severe punishments.
A key political reason behind the #XueBing case was the weekly gatherings initially organized by labor activist #WangJianbing at his apartment. Having witnessed repression in civil society for years, Wang believed it was essential to reunite people, rebuild connections & networks in civil society, and provide mutual support among young activists during the challenging times. He hoped to reestablish connections and explore new forms of activism. 


Both Wang and Huang played crucial roles in attempting to rebuild civil society in Guangzhou and deserve equally respectful coverage.
