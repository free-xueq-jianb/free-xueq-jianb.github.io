Wang Jianbing was criminally detained by the Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province on September 20, 2021, on suspicion of subversion of state power. On October 27 of the same year, this Procuratorate approved his formal arrest on charges of inciting subversion of state power, and he was arrested by the Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province on the same day.

The investigation of this case was resolved by the Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province. The defendants, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, were transferred to this Procuratorate for prosecution review on March 25, 2022, on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power. After accepting the case, this Procuratorate informed the defendants on March 28, 2022 that they had the right to appoint a lawyer, questioned the defendants in accordance with the law, listened to the defense attorneys’ arguments, and reviewed all case materials. During this period, the case was returned twice to the investigative agency for supplemental investigation. 

After review in accordance with the law, it was found that:

Since 2019, defendant Huang Xueqin has repeatedly published articles and remarks on online platforms and social media at home and abroad that misrepresented and attacked China’s government, attacked and slandered China's political system, and promoted ideas that subvert state power. In March 2021, while attending an online overseas news conference, defendant Huang Xueqin publicly made inflammatory remarks attacking and slandering China's state power.

From May 2020 to February 2021, defendant Huang Xueqin was recruited by overseas organizations, participated in the "Nonviolent Movement" online course training, and despite knowing that the course contained incitement to subvert China's state power, still recommended and solicited others to participate. Furthermore, during the training she assisted in roll-calling, broadcasting courseware, et cetera., and actively assisted in carrying out the "Nonviolent Movement" training activities.

From December 2020 to May 2021, the defendant Huang Xueqin used overseas video conferencing software to organize and hold the "Ten Lessons" program training, using major events and social movements at home and abroad as the content to incite participants to be dissatisfied with China's state power.

After graduating from university, defendant Wang Jianbing successively joined overseas network groups, such as the "China Jasmine Revolutionary Volunteer Corps" and the "June 4th Massacre Memorial Museum," with the purpose of subverting China's state power, and repeatedly posted or shared false statements and articles attacking China's political system and government on overseas social media  and other online platforms. From May to October 2020, while studying in the United Kingdom, defendant Wang Jianbing received training from the "Nonviolent Movement" online course.

Since November 2020, defendants Wang Jianbing and Huang Xueqin, together with co-defendant Chen *\[intentionally left blank]* Xiang (to be dealt with in a separate case), have used overseas communication software to post information about gatherings, regularly assembled many people for organized gatherings in defendant Wang Jianbing’s rented residence, Room 202, No. 149 Xingang West Road, Haizhu District, Guangzhou, and used the opportunity to discuss social topics and incite participants' dissatisfaction with China's state power.

On September 19, 2021, public security agency arrested defendants Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing near the rental residence of defendant Wang Jianbing.

The evidence for establishing the above facts is as follows:

3) Witness testimony; 

4) The confessions and defenses of defendants Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing;

6) Records of examination, inspection, identification, et cetera; and
