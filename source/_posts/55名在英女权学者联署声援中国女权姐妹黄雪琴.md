2021年年底到2022年年初，55名来自英国各大高校的女权学者参与联署，声援中国米兔活动家和独立记者黄雪琴，敦促中国驻英大使公开黄雪琴和王建兵的最新下落并尽快释放两人。

来自超过15所英国高校的55名女权学者，其中包括19名教授签署声援公开信，表达对来自中国的女权姐妹黄雪琴被拘捕和监禁事件的关切，要求中国相关部门尽快公开黄雪琴和王建兵的下落并无条件释放两人。

中国米兔活动家和独立记者黄雪琴为英国志奋领2021/2022奖学金中国得主，原计划于2021年9月前往英国萨赛克斯大学就读硕士学位。然而她和其友人职业病权益倡导者王建兵于9月19日于广州被秘密逮捕，如今已经失联超过四个月。

黄雪琴和王建兵因其所受到的政治打压已经受到国际社会的广泛关注和声援。自消息传到英国以来，已经有志奋领社群共112名奖学金学人签署声援公开信要求英国外交部与其旗下志奋领奖学金公开表态支持黄雪琴和王建兵。同时英国大学及学院工会（UCU）也发起联署要求中国当局无条件释放黄雪琴和王建兵。

由于黄雪琴在中国女权运动中的贡献，特别是在中国米兔运动和全球metoo运动中的积极行动，她遭遇的不公受到了英国女权学者们的广泛关切。

黄雪琴在英国的女权姐妹们发起了联署活动，自2021年年底以来，已经获得了55名来自英国各个高校和领域的女权学者的支持，其中包括19名资深教授。来自超过15所英国的大学女权学者联署了公开信，包括黄雪琴本该就读的萨克赛斯大学，还有知名大学比如剑桥大学、牛津大学、伦敦大学学院、华威大学、利兹大学等。

55位在英女权学者的声援展现了ta们作为女权主义者对于中国女权活动家者黄雪琴的强烈支持和跨越国界的姐妹情谊。作为国际女权社群的一部分，这些在英的女权学者们呼吁更多的女权主义者可以加入对黄雪琴和王建兵的声援，展现国际女权社群的团结力量。在文末，该联署强烈呼吁中国当局公开黄雪琴和王建兵的下落，并且无条件立即释放两人。

此联署已发至中国驻英国大使馆处，目前没有尚未收到任何回应（2022/2/11）。

以下为联署原文及参与学者名单：

An Open Letter to the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom in Support of HUANG Xueqin, a #Metoo Activist and Independent Journalist from China by Feminist Scholars Based in the UK

Dear Mr.Zheng Zeguang, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom,

I have the honour of delivering this open letter on behalf of 55 feminists based in the UK.

We are gravely concerned about the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of HUANG Xueqin. HUANG Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who had planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in September 2021. She is a leading #MeToo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China, whose inspiring life story is recorded in the article ‘Huang Xueqin: How could a journalist keep silent?’. [1]

International media has reported that HUANG Xueqin, together with her friend WANG Jianbing, a labour rights activist and #MeToo supporter, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China on 19 September 2021.[2] This occurred one day before Xueqin’s departure to take up her scholarship in the UK. Both remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared. A group of volunteers set up a website to update their situation. [3]
 
We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chinese feminist, Xueqin. This arrest seems to be only aimed at punishing her for her human rights activism. Such an act of repression is utterly shocking and unacceptable. 

As feminists based in the UK, we deeply appreciate Xueqin’s great contributions to both the Chinese and international #MeToo movement. We have been anticipating Xueqin’s arrival to UK to share her experiences and knowledge in feminist activism and journalism. It is disappointing that the University of Sussex and Chevening Scholarship have not released any public statement regarding the situation of Xueqin. We believe that her endeavours to promote awareness of sexual harassment and the need for gender equality should be honoured and remembered rather than being censored.

We stand in solidarity with our feminist sister: HUANG Xueqin. In the knowledge that it is extremely politically high-risk for Chinese feminists to openly voice their concern, we speak out as an international feminist community and hope feminists in the UK can join us to call for Xueqin and Jianbing’s release. We invite anyone who is deeply concerned with feminism, labour rights issues and civil society in China to sign this open letter.

We strongly urge Chinese authorities to disclose the whereabouts of HUANG Xueqin and WANG Jianbing and release them immediately and unconditionally.
