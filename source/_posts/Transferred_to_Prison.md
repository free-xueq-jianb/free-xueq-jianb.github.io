Case Update: #HuangXueqin and #WangJianbing Have Been Transferred to Prison to Serve Their Sentences

On September 10, the Higher Court of Guangdong Province handed down an unexpected and secret judgment on the “XueBing Case,” rejecting the appeals of Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing. On September 20, the two received a notice of execution for sentences from the court. Recently, it was learned that the two were officially transferred to prison on October 17 to serve the remainder of their sentences: Huang Xueqin has been held in Guangdong Provincial Women's Prison and Wang Jianbing has been held in Guangdong Provincial Yangchun Prison.

The status of the two after their transfer to prison is still unknown, so please keep an eye on them. We will continue to stand in solidarity with them and support them in exhausting all legal means to expose the injustice and absurdity of this political repression.

## Please send your wishes and support to XueBing via postcards!
