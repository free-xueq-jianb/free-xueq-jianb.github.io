Dear Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Chevening Leadership team,
I have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).
We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.
Huang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.

A joint statement in support of Huang Xueqin, a #Metoo activist, independent journalist and a 2021/22 Chevening scholar from China, and her fellow, Wang Jianbing Credible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.

We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.

Chevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.

Last but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.
