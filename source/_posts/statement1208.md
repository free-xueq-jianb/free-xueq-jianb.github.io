尊敬的外交、聯邦和發展辦公室 (FCDO) 和志奮領領導團隊，

Dear Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Chevening Leadership team,

我有幸代表 112 位志奮領學者（Chevenors）發表聯合聲明。

I have the honour of delivering this joint statement on behalf of 112 Chevening scholars (Chevenors).

我們對黃雪琴和她的同胞王建兵被任意監禁的人權現況，且家屬與律師無法探視的狀況，表示嚴重關切。

We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Huang, Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing.

黃雪琴是志奮領學者中國2021/22得主，原計劃於今年9月前往英國在薩塞克斯大學就讀研究所學位。她是中國#Metoo運動活動家和獨立調查記者。

Huang, Xueqin is a Chevening Scholar from China who planned to travel to the UK to commence postgraduate studies at the University of Sussex in this September. She is a leading #Metoo activist and an independent investigative journalist in China.

國際媒體和持續追蹤此人權個案的臉書粉絲專頁「Freexueqin黄雪琴&Jianbing王建兵」發布的可信消息顯示，黃雪琴與好友王建兵於今年9月19日被中國廣東省廣州市警方秘密逮捕，家屬與律師至今未能會見。

A joint statement in support of Huang Xueqin, a #Metoo activist, independent journalist and a 2021/22 Chevening scholar from China, and her fellow, Wang Jianbing Credible information released on international media and the Facebook fan page “Free Xueqin and Jianbing” indicates that Huang Xueqin, together with her friend, Wang Jianbing, were secretly arrested by the police of Guangzhou city, China Guangdong province on 19 September this year and remain incommunicado since they were forcibly disappeared.

我們對中國當局任意逮捕和拘留黃雪琴及其同伴王建兵表示極度關切，因為這似乎只是為了懲罰她和她的同伴的合法人權活動。

We express our utmost concern over the arbitrary arrest and detention of Chevenor Huang Xueqin as it seems to be only aimed at punishing her and her fellow for their legitimate human rights activities.

志奮領獎學金是世界上最具影響力的獎學金之一，崇尚寬容、公平和社會正義的價值觀。志奮領秘書處透過校友電子郵件，不斷更新志奮領網絡上的精彩故事，也分享了衝突國家的局勢，比如阿富汗的現狀。這些校友郵件為志奮領社區提供了創新理念和世界人權狀況的重要信息。因此，我們敦促志奮領領導與我們站在一起，透過寄發校友郵件，呼籲整體志奮領社區關注黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件。我們敦促志奮領領導層與我們站在一起，公開呼籲釋放志奮領黃雪琴和她的同伴。我們還敦促 FDCO 就黃雪琴及其同事王建兵的案件，與中國當局展開佈線層級的人權對話。

Chevening is one of the most influential scholarships in the world that enshrines values of tolerance, fairness, and social justice. Chevening Alumni Office has kept updated impressive stories from the Chevening network and has also shared the situation in countries in conflict, such as the current situation of Afghanistan. These alumni emails empower the Chevening community with innovative ideas and also the important information of human rights situation in the world. We, thus, urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to call for the attention of the Chevening community on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow, Wang Jianbing. We urge the Chevening leadership to stand with us to publicly call for the release of Chevenor Huang Xueqin, and her fellow. We also urge the FDCO to create a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the case of Huang Xueqin and her fellow Wang Jianbing.

最後，我們要求中國當局立即披露黃雪琴與王建兵的下落，並無條件釋放黃雪琴和王建兵。

Last but not least, we urge the Chinese authorities to immediately disclose their whereabouts and unconditionally release Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing.
