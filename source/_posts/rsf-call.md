无国界记者组织（RSF）呼吁中国当局立即释放调查记者黄雪琴，黄上周在广州市被捕并被单独关押。

中国独立记者黄雪琴（Sophia Huang）因参与中国#MeToo运动而闻名，2021年9月19日因涉嫌“煽动颠覆国家政权”在广州市被捕。黄雪琴原本准备离开中国前往英国留学，外界认为警方目前对她采取“指定居所监视居住”（RSDL），意即单独监禁在中国政权的“黑牢”，囚犯在里面经常受到酷刑。

RSF东亚办事处执行长艾玮昂坚决表示：“黄雪琴是一位杰出的记者，她不过是透过调查社会问题来为中国的公众利益服务，为此遭怀疑颠覆政权令人愤慨。”他呼吁当局“立即释放黄雪琴与所有被关在中国的记者和新闻自由捍卫人士”。

黄雪琴之前曾于2019年因报导香港民主抗议活动而被以“寻衅滋事罪”关押三个月。

中国在2021 RSF世界新闻自由指数180国中排名第177，是世界上最大的记者监狱，目前至少有122名记者身陷囹圄。

以下為英文原文：

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls for the immediate release of Chinese investigative journalist Huang Xueqin, who was arrested last week in the city of Guangzhou and is being held incommunicado.

Chinese independent journalist Huang Xueqin (Sophia Huang), famous for her involvement in the #MeToo movement in China, was arrested on 19th September, 2021 in the southern city of Guangzhou under suspicion of ‘inciting subversion of state power’. Huang, who was preparing to leave China to study in the United Kingdom, is believed to be held under "Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location" (RSDL), a term that refers to solitary confinement in the regime's "black prisons", in which the prisoners are often tortured.

“Huang Xueqin is a prominent journalist who was only serving the Chinese public interest by investigating social issues, and it is outrageous to suspect her of subversion”, insists Reporters Without Borders (RSF) East-Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who calls for Huang’s “immediate release alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in China.” 

Huang Xueqin was previously detained for three months in 2019 under the charge of ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble’ for covering the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. 

China, ranked 177th out of 180 in the 2021 RSF World Press Freedom Index, is the world's largest captor of journalists with at least 122 detained.
